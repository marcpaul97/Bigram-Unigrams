</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Children</span>:</p>

<p>This is a quite different book from any others you
may have read about me. In this volume I have some
adventures with real children, like yourselves, as well
as with my animal friends.</p>

<p>These stories tell of the joyous, funny, exciting and
everyday adventures that happen to you girls and
boys. There is the story about a toothache, which
you may read, or have read to you, when you want to
forget the pain. There is a story of a good boy and
a freckled girl. And there is a story about a bad boy,
but not everyone is allowed to read that.</p>

<p>There is a story for nearly every occasion in the life
of a little boy or girl; about the joys of Christmas,
of a birthday; about different animals, about getting
lost, and one about falling in a mud puddle. And
there are stories about having the measles and mumps,
and getting over them.</p>

<p>I hope you will like this book as well as you seem
to have cared for the other volumes about me. And
you will find some beautiful pictures in this book.</p>

<p>Now, as Nurse Jane is calling me, I shall have to
hop along. But I hope you will enjoy these stories.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY'S TOOTHACHE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a boy who had the toothache.
It was not a very large tooth that pained him, and, really, it
was quite surprising how such a very large ache got into such
a small tooth. At least that is what the boy thought.</p>

<p>"But I'm not going to the dentist and let him pull it!" cried
the boy, holding his hand over his mouth. "And I'm not going
to let anybody in this house pull it, either! So there!" He
ran and hid himself in a corner. Girls aren't that way when
they have the toothache&mdash;only boys.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the tooth will not need pulling," said Mother, as
she looked at the boy and saw how much pain he had.</p>

<p>"That's so!" exclaimed Grandma, who was trying to think
of some way in which to help the boy. "Maybe the dentist can
make a little hole in your tooth, Sonny, and fill the hole with
cement, as the man filled the hole in our sidewalk, and then all
your pain will stop."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
"No, I'm not going to the dentist! I'm not going, I tell
you!" cried Sonny. And I think he stamped his foot on the
floor, the least little bit. It may have been that he saw a tack
sticking up, and wanted to hammer it down with his shoe. But
I am afraid it was a stamp of his foot; and afterward that boy
was sorry.</p>

<p>But, anyhow, his tooth kept on aching, and it was the kind
called "jumping," for it was worse at one time than another.
Sometimes the boy thought the pain jumped from one side of
his tongue to the other side, and again it seemed that it leaped
away up to the roof of his mouth.</p>

<p>The toothache even seemed to turn somersaults and peppersaults,
and once it appeared to jump over backward. But it
never completely jumped away, which is what the boy wished
it would do.</p>

<p>"You'd better let me take you to the dentist's," said his
Mother. "He'll either fix the tooth so it won't ache any more,
or he'll take it out, so a new tooth will grow in. And, really,
the pain the dentist may cause will only be a little one, and it
will be all over in a moment. While your tooth may ache all
night."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not going to the dentist! I'm not going!" cried
Sonny boy, and then again he acted just as if there were a
tack in the carpet that needed hammering down with his foot.</p>

<p>Now it was about this time that Uncle Wiggily Longears,
the bunny rabbit gentleman, was hopping from his hollow
stump bungalow in the woods to go look for an adventure.
But, as yet, Uncle Wiggily knew nothing about the boy with
the toothache. That came a little later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
"Are you going to be gone long?" asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, of the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"Only just long enough to have a nice adventure," answered
Mr. Longears, and away he hopped on his red, white and blue
striped rheumatism crutch, with his pink, twinkling nose held
in front of him like the headlight on a choo-choo train.</p>

<p>Now, as it happened, Uncle Wiggily's hollow stump bungalow
was not far from the house where the Toothache Boy lived,
though the boy had never seen the rabbit's home. He had
often wandered in the woods, almost in front of the bunny's
bungalow, but, not having the proper sort of eyes, the boy had
never seen Uncle Wiggily. It needs very sharp eyes to see
the creatures of the woods and fields, and to find the little
houses in which they live.</p>

<p>At any rate the boy had never noticed Uncle Wiggily, though
the bunny gentleman had often seen the boy. Many a time
when you go through the woods the animal folk look out at
and see you, when you never even know they are there.</p>

<p>And pretty soon Uncle Wiggily hopped right past the house
where the Toothache Boy lived. And just then, for about the
tenth time, Mother was saying:</p>

<p>"You had better let me take you to the dentist and have
that toothache stopped, Sonny."</p>

<p>"No! No! I don't want to! I&mdash;I'm a&mdash;a&mdash;I guess it will
stop itself," said the boy, hopeful like.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily, hiding in the bushes in front of the boy's
house, sat up on his hind legs and twinkled his pink nose. By
a strange and wonderful new power which he had, the bunny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
gentleman could hear and understand boy and girl talk, though
he could not speak it himself. So it was no trouble at all for
Uncle Wiggily to know what that boy was saying.</p>

<p>"He's afraid; that's what the boy is," said the bunny uncle
to himself, leaning on his red, white and blue striped crutch.
"He's afraid to go to the dentist and have that tooth filled, or
pulled. Now that's very silly of him, for the dentist will not
hurt him much, and will soon stop the ache. I wonder how I
can make that boy believe this? His mother and grandmother
can't seem to."</p>

<p>For Mr. Longears heard Mother and Grandma trying to get
that Toothache Boy to let them take him to the dentist. But
the boy only shook his head, and made believe hammer tacks
in the carpet with his foot, and he held his hand over his mouth.
But, all the while, the ache kept aching achier and achier and
jumping, leaping, tumbling, twisting, turning and flip-flopping&mdash;almost
like a clown in the circus.</p>

<p>"No! No! I'm not going to the dentist!" cried the boy.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily had an idea. He could look in through
the window of the house and see the boy. In front of the window
was a grassy place, near the edge of the wood, and close
by was an old stump, shaped almost like the easy chair in a
dentist's office.</p>

<p>"I know what I'll do," said Uncle Wiggily. "I'll make believe
I have the toothache. I'll go get Dr. Possum and I'll
sit down in this stump chair. Then I'll tell Dr. Possum to
make believe pull out one of my teeth."</p>

<p>"I s'pose if Nurse Jane were here she might ask what good
that would do?" thought Uncle Wiggily. "But I think it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
do a lot of good. If that boy sees me, a rabbit gentleman,
having a tooth pulled, which is what he will think he sees, it
may make him brave enough to go to the dentist's. I'll try it."</p>

<p>Away hopped Uncle Wiggily to Dr. Possum's office.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Rheumatism again?" asked the animal
doctor.</p>

<p>"No, but I want you to come over and pull a tooth for me,"
said Uncle Wiggily, blinking one eye, and twinkling his pink
nose surreptitious-like.</p>

<p>"Pull a tooth! Why, your teeth are all right!" cried Dr.
Possum.</p>

<p>"It's to give a little lesson to a boy," whispered the bunny,
and then Dr. Possum blinked one eye, in understanding fashion.</p>

<p>A little later Uncle Wiggily sat himself down on the old
stump that looked like a chair, and Dr. Possum stood over him.</p>

<p>"Open your mouth and show me which tooth it is that hurts,"
said Dr. Possum, just like a dentist.</p>

<p>"All right," answered Uncle Wiggily, and, from the corner
of his left eye the bunny gentleman could see the Toothache
Boy at the window looking out. The boy saw the rabbit and
Dr. Possum at the old stump, and he saw Mr. Longears open
his mouth and point with his paw to a tooth.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother!" cried the boy, very much excited. "Look!
There's a funny rabbit, all dressed up in a tall silk hat, having
a tooth pulled. Grandma, look!"</p>

<p>"Well, I do declare!" murmured the old lady. "Isn't that
perfectly wonderful! I didn't know that animals ever had
the toothache!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I s'pose they do, once in a while," said the Toothache
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Boy's mother. "But see how brave that rabbit gentleman is!
Not to mind having the animal dentist stop his ache! Just
fancy!"</p>

<p>Neither Grandma nor Mother said anything to Sonny Boy.
All three of them just stood at the window, and watched Uncle
Wiggily and Dr. Possum. And, as they looked, Dr. Possum
put a little shiny thing, like a buttonhook, in the bunny gentleman's
mouth. He gave a sudden little pull and, a moment
later, held up something which sparkled in the sun. It was
only a bit of glass, which Uncle Wiggily had held in his paw
ready for this part in the little play, but it looked like a tooth.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" laughed Grandma. "The bunny had his
tooth pulled!"</p>

<p>"And he doesn't seem to mind it at all," added Mother.</p>

<p>Surely enough, Uncle Wiggily hopped off the make-believe
dentist-stump, and with his red, white and blue striped rheumatism
crutch, began to dance a little jiggity-jig with Dr.
Possum.</p>

<p>"This dance is to show that it doesn't hurt even to have a
tooth pulled; much less to have one filled," said the bunny.</p>

<p>"I understand!" laughed Dr. Possum. And as he and Uncle
Wiggily danced, they looked, out of the corners of their eyes,
and saw the Toothache Boy standing at the window watching
them.</p>

<p>"Well, I never, in all my born days, saw a sight like that!"
exclaimed Grandma.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Mother. "Isn't it wonderful!"</p>

<p>Sonny Boy took his hand down from his mouth.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess, Mother," he said, as he saw Uncle Wiggily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
jump over his crutch in a most happy fashion, "I guess I'll go
to the dentist, and have him stop my toothache!"</p>

<p>"Hurray!" softly cried Uncle Wiggily, who heard what the
boy said. "This is just what I wanted to happen, Dr. Possum!
Our little lesson is over. Now we may go!"</p>

<p>Away hopped the bunny, to tell Nurse Jane about the
strange adventure, and Dr. Possum, with his bag of powders
and pills on his tail, where he always carried it, shuffled back
to his office.</p>

<p>Sonny Boy went to the dentist's, and soon his tooth was
fixed so it would not ache again. He hardly felt at all what
the dentist did to him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't know how easy it was 'till I saw the rabbit have
his tooth pulled," said the boy to the dentist.</p>

<p>"Hum," said the dentist, noncommittal-like, "some rabbits
are very funny!"</p>

<p>And if the puppy dog doesn't waggle his tail so hard that he
knocks over the milk bottle when it's trying to slide down the
doormat, I shall have the pleasure, next, of telling you the
story of Uncle Wiggily and the freckled girl.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">STORY II</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FRECKLED GIRL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was hopping through the woods one summer
day, when, as he happened to stop to get a drink of some
water that the rain-clouds had dropped in the cup of a Jack-in-the-pulpit
flower, the bunny gentleman heard a girl saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I could get them off! I wish I could scrub them
off with sandpaper, or something like that! I've tried lemon
juice and vinegar, but they won't go. And oh, they make me
so homely!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily stopped suddenly and rubbed the end of his
pink, twinkling nose with the brim of his tall, silk hat.</p>

<p>"This is very queer," said the bunny uncle to himself. "I
wonder what is it she has tried to take off with lemon juice?
She seems very unhappy, this little girl does."</p>

<p>The bunny uncle looked through the trees and, seated on a
green, mossy stump, he saw a girl about ten or twelve years old.
She held a looking-glass in her hand, and as she glanced at her
likeness in the mirror she kept saying:</p>

<p>"How can I get them off? How can I make them disappear
so I will be beautiful? Oh, how I hate them!"</p>

<p>"What in the world can be the matter?" thought Uncle
Wiggily to himself. For, as I have told you, the bunny gentleman
was now able to hear and understand the talk of girls and
boys, though he could not himself speak that language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
He hopped a little closer to the unhappy girl on the green,
mossy stump, but the bunny stepped so softly on the leaf carpet
of the forest that scarcely a sound did he make, and the girl
with the mirror never heard him.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I said a little verse, such as I have read in fairy
books, whether they would go away?" murmured the girl. "I've
tried everything but that. I'll do it&mdash;I'll say a magical verse!
But I must make up one, for I never have read of the kind I
want in any book."</p>

<p>She seemed to be thinking deeply for a moment and then,
shutting her eyes, and looking up at the sun which was shining
through the trees of the wood, the girl recited this little verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Sun, sun, who made them come,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Make them go away.</span><br />
<span class="i4">Then I'll be like other girls,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Happy all the day!"</span>
</div></div>

<p>"This is like a puzzle, or a riddle," whispered Uncle Wiggily
to himself, as he kept out of sight behind a bush near the stump.
"What is it she wants the sun to make go away? It can't be
rain, or storm clouds, for the sky is as blue as a baby's eyes. I
wonder what it is?"</p>

<p>Then, as the girl took up the mirror again, and looked in it,
Uncle Wiggily saw the reflection of her face.</p>

<p>It was covered with dear, little brown freckles!</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho!" softly crooned Uncle Wiggily to himself. "Now
I understand. This girl is unhappy because she is freckled.
She thinks she doesn't look pretty with them! Why, if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
only knew it, those freckles show how strong and healthy she
is. They show that she has played out in the fresh air and
sunshine, and that she will live to be happy a long, long while.
Freckles! Why, she ought to be glad she has them, instead
of sorry!"</p>

<p>But the girl on the stump kept her eyes shut, clenching the
mirror in her hand and as she held her face up to the sun she
recited another verse of what she thought was a mystic charm.</p>

<p>This is what she said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Freckles, freckles, go away!</span><br />
<span class="i4">Don't come back any other day.</span><br />
<span class="i4">Make my face most fair to see,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Then how happy I will be!"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Slowly, as Uncle Wiggily watched, hidden as he was behind
the bush, the girl opened her eyes and held up the looking-glass.
Over her shoulder the bunny gentleman could still see
the freckles in the glass; the dear, brown, honest, healthy
freckles. But when the girl saw them she dropped the mirror,
hid her face in her hands and cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, they didn't go 'way! They didn't go 'way! Now I
never can be beautiful!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily twinkled his pink nose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"This is too bad!" said the bunny gentleman. "I wonder
how I can help that girl?" For, since he had helped the Toothache
Boy by letting Dr. Possum pretend to pull an aching
tooth, the bunny gentleman wanted do other favors for the
children who loved him.</p>

<p>"I'd like to make that girl happy, even with her freckles,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
said the bunny. "I'll hop off through the woods, and perhaps
I may meet some of my animal friends who will show me a
way."</p>

<p>The bunny gentleman looked kindly at the girl on the stump.
She was sobbing, and did not see him, or hear him, as she murmured
over and over again:</p>

<p>"I don't like freckles! I hate them!"</p>

<p>Away through the woods hopped Uncle Wiggily. He had
not gone very far before he heard a bird singing a beautiful
song. Oh, so cheerful it was, and happy&mdash;that song!</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Bird!" greeted Uncle Wiggily, for you
know it is the father bird who sings the sweetest song. The
mother bird is so busy, I suppose, that she has little time to
sing. "You are very happy this morning," the rabbit said to
the bird.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Uncle Wiggily, I am very happy," answered Mr.
Bird, "and so is my wife. She is up there on the nest, but she
told me to come down here and sing a happy song."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the bunny.</p>

<p>"Because we are going to have some little birds," was the
answer. "There are some eggs in our nest, and my mate is
sitting on them to keep them warm. Soon some little birds
will come out, and I will sing a still happier song."</p>

<p>"That's fine," said Uncle Wiggily, thinking of the unhappy
freckled girl on the stump. "May I see the eggs in your nest?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered the father-singer. "Our nest is in a
low bush, but it is well hidden. Here, I'll show you. Mrs.
Bird will not mind if you look."</p>

<p>The father bird fluttered to the nest, and Mrs. Bird raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
her fluffy feathers to show Uncle Wiggily some beautiful blue
eggs.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, they're <i>freckled</i>!" exclaimed the bunny gentleman.
"Aren't you birds sad because you have freckled eggs?
Why, your little birds will be freckled, too! And, if they are
girl birds they will cry!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Mr. Bird in surprise. "Why will our girl
birdies cry?"</p>

<p>"Because they'll be <i>freckled</i>," answered the bunny. "I just
saw a girl in the woods, crying to break her heart because she
is freckled!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" chirped Mrs. Bird. "In the first place these
are not freckles on my eggs, though they look so. My eggs are
spotted, or mottled, and they would not be half so pretty if
they were not colored that way. Besides, being spotted as
they are, makes them not so easily seen in the nest. And, when
I fly away to get food, bad snakes or cats can not so easily see
my eggs to eat them. I just love my <i>freckled</i> eggs, as you call
them!" laughed Mrs. Bird.</p>

<p>"Well, they are pretty," admitted Uncle Wiggily. "But
will your little birds be speckled, too?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," sang Mr. Bird. "Say, Uncle Wiggily!" he
whistled, "if we could get that girl here so she could see our
spotted eggs, and know how beautiful they are, even if they
are what she would call 'freckled'; wouldn't that make her
happier?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would," said the bunny rabbit. "I never thought
of that. I'll try it! You will not be afraid to let her see your
eggs, will you?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
"No; for girls are not like some boys&mdash;they don't rob the
nests of birds," replied the mother of the speckled eggs. "Bring
the unhappy girl here, and Mr. Bird and I will hide in the
bushes while she peeps into our nest."</p>

<p>"I will!" said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>Away he hopped through the woods, and soon he came to
the place where the freckled girl was still sobbing on the
stump.</p>

<p>"Now how can I get her to follow me through the woods,
to see the nest, when I can't talk to her?" whispered Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>Then he thought of a plan.</p>

<p>"I'll toss a little piece of tree-bark at her," chuckled the
bunny. "That will make her look up, and when she sees me
I'll hop off a little way. She'll follow, thinking she can catch
me. But I'll keep ahead of her and so lead her to the woods.
I want to make her happy!"</p>

<p>The bunny tossed a bit of bark, hitting the girl on her head.
She looked around, and then she saw Uncle Wiggily, all dressed
up as he was with his tall silk hat and his red, white and blue
striped rheumatism crutch.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a funny rabbit!" exclaimed the girl, smiling
through her tears, and forgetting her freckles, for a while at
least. "I wonder if I can catch you?" she said.</p>

<p>"Well, not if I know it," whispered Uncle Wiggily to himself,
for he knew what the girl had said. "But I'll let you
think you can," the bunny chuckled to himself.</p>

<p>He hopped on a little farther, and the girl followed. But
just as she thought she was going to put her hands on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
rabbit, Uncle Wiggily skipped along, and she missed him. But
still she followed on, and soon Uncle Wiggily had led her to
the bushes where the birds had built their nest.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bird were watching, and when they saw Uncle
Wiggily and the freckled girl, Mr. Bird began to sing. He
sang of blue skies, or rippling waters of sunshine and sweet
breezes scented with apple blossoms.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lovely song!" murmured the freckled girl.
"Some birds must live here. I wonder if I could see their nest
and eggs? I wouldn't hurt them for the world!" she said
softly.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily shrank back out of sight. The girl looked
around for the singing birds, and just then the wind blew aside
some leaves and she saw the nest. But she saw more than
the nest, for she saw the eggs that were to be hatched into little
birds. And, more than this; the girl saw that the eggs were
spotted or mottled&mdash;freckled as she was herself!</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" murmured the girl, clasping her hands as she
looked down at the speckled eggs in the nest. "They have
brown spots on, just like my face. They are <i>freckled eggs</i>&mdash;but,
oh, how pretty they are! I never knew that anything
freckled could be beautiful! I never knew! Oh, how wonderful!"</p>

<p>As she stood looking at the eggs, Mr. Bird sang again, a
sweeter song than before, and the wind blew softly on the
freckled face of the unhappy girl&mdash;no, not unhappy now, for
she smiled, and there were no more tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, how glad I am that the funny rabbit led me to the nest
of freckled eggs!" said the girl. "I wonder where he is?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
She looked around, but Uncle Wiggily had hopped away.
He had done all that was needed of him.</p>

<p>The mother bird softly fluttered down into her nest, covering
the beautiful mottled eggs with her downy wings. She was
not afraid of the girl. The girl reached out her hand and timidly
stroked the mother bird. Then she gently touched her own
freckled cheeks.</p>

<p>"I'm never going to care any more," she whispered. "I did
not know that freckles could be so pretty. I'm glad I got 'em!"</p>

<p>The freckled girl walked away, leaving the mother bird on
the nest, while the father of the speckled eggs, that soon would
be little birds, sang his song of joy. The freckled girl, with
a glad smile on her face, went back to the stump, and, without
looking into the mirror, she tossed the bit of looking-glass into
a deep spring.</p>

<p>"I don't need you any more," she said, as the glass went
sailing through the air. "I know, now, that freckles can be
beautiful!"</p>

<p>And if the pussy cat doesn't think the automobile tire is a
bologna sausage, and try to nibble a piece out to make a sandwich
for the rag doll's picnic, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the mud puddle.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">STORY III</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MUD PUDDLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Did you ever fall down in a mud puddle? Perhaps this may
have happened to you when you were barefooted, with old
clothes on, so that it did not much matter whether you splashed
them or not.</p>

<p>But that isn't what I mean.</p>

<p>Did you ever fall into a mud puddle when you had on your
very best clothes, with white stockings that showed every speck
of mud? If anything like that ever happened to you, when
you were going to Sunday-school, or to a little afternoon tea
party, why, you know how dreadfully unhappy you felt! To
say nothing of the pain in your knees!</p>

<p>Well, now for a story of how a little boy named Tommie
fell in a mud puddle, and how Uncle Wiggily helped him scrub
the mud off his white stockings&mdash;off Tommie's white stockings
I mean, not Uncle Wiggily's.</p>

<p>Tommie was a little boy who lived in a house on the edge
of the wood, near where Uncle Wiggily had built his hollow
stump bungalow. No, Tommie wasn't the same little boy who
had the toothache. He was quite a different chap.</p>

<p>One day the postman rang the bell at Tommie's house, and
gave Tommie a cute little letter.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's for me!" cried Tommie. "Look, Mother! I have
a letter!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
"That's nice," said Mother. "Who sent it to you?"</p>

<p>"I'll look and tell you," answered the little boy. The writing
in the letter was large and plain, and though Tommie had
not been to school very long he could read a little. So he was
able to tell that the letter was from a little girl named Alice,
who wanted him to come to a party she was going to have one
afternoon a few days later.</p>

<p>"Oh, may I go?" Tommie asked his mother.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

<p>"And wear my best clothes?"</p>

<p>"Surely you will put on your best clothes to go to the party,"
said Mother. "And I hope you have a nice time!"</p>

<p>Tommie hoped so, too. But if only he had known what was
going to happen! Perhaps it is just as well he did not, for it
would have spoiled his fun of thinking about the coming party.
And half the fun of nearly everything, you know, is thinking
about it beforehand, or afterward.</p>

<p>At last the day came for the tea party Alice was to give at
her home, which was a little distance down the street from
Tommie's house.</p>

<p>"Oh, how happy I am!" sang Tommie, as he ran about the
porch.</p>

<p>But when, after breakfast, it began to rain, Tommie was not
so happy. He stood with his nose pressed against the glass of
the window until it was pressed quite flat. I mean his nose
was flat, for the glass was that way anyhow, you know. And
Tommie watched the rain drops splash down, making little
mud puddles in the street.</p>

<p>"Can't I go to Alice's party if it rains?" asked Tommie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
"Well, no, I think not," Mother answered. "But perhaps
it will stop raining before it is time for you to go. You don't
have to leave here until after lunch."</p>

<p>Tommie turned again to press his nose against the glass, glad
that the rain was outside, so that the drops which rolled down
the window could not wet his face. And he hoped the clouds
would clear away and that the sun would shine before the time
for the party.</p>

<p>Now about this same hour Uncle Wiggily Longears, the
bunny rabbit gentleman, was also looking out of the window
of his hollow stump bungalow in the woods, wondering, just
as Tommie wondered, whether the rain would stop.</p>

<p>"But surely you won't go out while it is still raining," said
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper.</p>

<p>"No," answered Uncle Wiggily, "my going out is not so
needful as all that. I was going to look for an adventure, and
I had rather do that in the sunshine than in the rain. I can
wait."</p>

<p>And then, almost as suddenly as it had started, the rain
stopped.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad!" sang Tommie, as he danced up and down.
"Now I can go to the party!"</p>

<p>"And I can go adventuring," said Uncle Wiggily. Now of
course he did not hear Tommie, nor did the little boy hear the
bunny. But, all the same, they were to have an adventure
together.</p>

<p>Tommie had been ready, for some time, to start down the
street to go to the party Alice was giving for her little girl
and boy friends. All that Tommie needed, now, was to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
his collar and tie put on, and his hair combed again, for it
had become rather tossed and twisted topsy-turvy when he
pressed his head against the window, watching the rain.</p>

<p>"Be careful of mud puddles!" Tommie's mother called to
him, as, all spick and span, he started down the street toward
the home of Alice, a block or so distant. "Don't fall in any
puddles!"</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," Tommie promised.</p>

<p>And as Uncle Wiggily started out about this same time for
his adventure, Nurse Jane called to the bunny:</p>

<p>"Be careful not to get wet on account of your rheumatism."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," promised Uncle Wiggily, just as Tommie
had done.</p>

<p>Now everything would have been all right if Tommie had
not stubbed his toe as he was going along the street, about half
way to the party. But he did stumble, where one sidewalk
stone was raised up higher than another, and, before he could
save himself, down in the mud puddle fell poor Tommie! He
fell on his hands and knees, and they were both soaked in the
muddy water of the puddle on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Of course it did not so much matter about Tommie's hands.
He could easily wash the mud and brown water off them. But
it was different with his white stockings. Perhaps I forgot to
tell you that Tommie wore white stockings to the party. But
he did, and now the knees of these stockings were all mud!</p>

<p>And as he looked at his mud-soiled stockings, and at his
hands, from which water was dripping down on the sides of
his legs, Tommie could not help crying.</p>

<p>"I can't go to the party this way!" sobbed Tommie to himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for he was big enough to go down the street alone, and
there were no other children on it just then. "I can't go to the
party this way! But if I go home Mother will make me change
my things, and I'll be late, and maybe she won't let me go at
all! Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>And in order to keep out of sight of any other boys or girls
who might come along, Tommie stepped behind some bushes
that grew along the street.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/p022_650.jpg" width="650" height="431" alt="He looked down at his mud-soiled stockings" />
</div>

<p>And what was his surprise to see, sitting on a stone, behind
this same bush, an old gentleman rabbit, wearing glasses, and
with a tall silk hat on his head. On the ground beside him was
a red, white and blue striped crutch, for rheumatism.</p>

<p>But the funniest thing about the rabbit gentleman (who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
as you have guessed, was Uncle Wiggily), the funniest thing
was that he had a bunch of dried grass in one paw, and he was
busy scrubbing some dried spots of mud off his trousers. So
busy was Uncle Wiggily doing this that he neither saw nor
heard Tommie come behind the bush. And Tommie was so
surprised at seeing Uncle Wiggily that the little boy never
said a word.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why!" thought Tommie, as he saw the bunny take
up a pine tree cone, which was like a nutmeg grater, and scrape
the dried mud off his trousers, "he must have fallen into a
mud puddle just as I did!"</p>

<p>And that is just what had happened to Uncle Wiggily. He
had been walking along, thinking of an adventure he might
have, when he splashed into a puddle and spattered himself
with mud!</p>

<p>But, instead of crying, Uncle Wiggily set about making the
best of it&mdash;cleaning himself off so he would look nice again, to
go in search of an adventure.</p>

<p>"I'll let the mud dry in the sun," said Uncle Wiggily out
loud, speaking to himself, with his back partly turned to Tommie.
"Then it will easily scrape off."</p>

<p>The sun was so warm, after the rain, that it soon dried the
mud on the bunny gentleman's clothes, and with the bunch of
grass, and the sharp pine tree cone, he soon had loosened the
bits of dirt.</p>

<p>"Now I'm all right again," said Uncle Wiggily out loud.
And though of course Tommie did not understand rabbit talk,
the little boy could see what Uncle Wiggily had done to help
himself after the mud puddle accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
"I say!" cried Tommie, before he thought, "will you please
lend me that pine tree cone clothes brush? I want to clean the
mud off my white stockings so I can go to the party!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily looked up in surprise! He had not known,
before, that Tommie was there; but the bunny heard what the
little boy said. With a low and polite bow of his tall silk
hat, Uncle Wiggily tossed the bunch of grass and the pine cone
to Tommie. By that time the mud had dried so the little boy
could scrape most of it off his stockings.</p>

<p>"I hope you have a nice time at the party," said Uncle
Wiggily, in rabbit language, of course. And then, as Tommie
scraped the last of the dried mud away, leaving only a few
spots on his stockings, the bunny gentleman hopped out of
the bush and on his way.</p>

<p>"And I can go to Alice's house without having to run home
to change my stockings," thought Tommie. "I wonder who
that rabbit was?"</p>

<p>And when Tommie reached the party he found that he was
not the only little boy who had fallen in a mud puddle. The
same thing had happened to Sammie and Johnnie, two other
boys.</p>

<p>"But how did you get your stockings so clean, without going
home and changing them?" asked the other boys of Tommie.</p>

<p>"Oh, an old rabbit gentleman, with a tall silk hat and a red,
white and blue crutch showed me how to scrape off the dried
mud with a pine cone," Tommie answered. "I cleaned my
white stockings as the bunny brushed his clothes."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that a fairy story?" cried the boys and girls at Alice's
party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
"Well, he <i>looked</i> like a fairy!" laughed Tommie, who had
washed his hands in the bath room at Alice's house, so they
were clean for eating cake and ice cream. "And I'm not afraid
of mud puddles any more. I know what to do if I fall in one,"
said Tommie.</p>

<p>And if the onion doesn't make tears come into the eyes of
the potato when they're playing tag around the spoon in the
soup dish, the next story will be about Uncle Wiggily and
the bad boy.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">STORY IV</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BAD BOY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a bad boy. He lived on the
edge of the wood in which Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny
rabbit gentleman, had built his hollow stump bungalow. The
bad boy did not know Uncle Wiggily, but Mr. Longears knew
about the bad boy, and so did Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
bunny's muskrat lady housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Don't ever go near that bad boy's house," said Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy one morning, as the rabbit gentleman started out with
his red, white and blue striped rheumatism crutch.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Because," answered Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, "that boy will
throw stones at you, and maybe hit you on your pink, twinkling
nose."</p>

<p>"He can't throw stones now," said Uncle Wiggily. "He
can't find any. The ground is covered with snow."</p>

<p>"Then he'll throw snowballs at you," said the muskrat lady
housekeeper. "Please keep away from him."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," promised the bunny gentleman, as he
hopped away, with his tall, silk hat on his head.</p>

<p>Now you know why, once upon a time, there was a bad boy.
He was bad because he threw stones and snowballs at rabbits
and other animals. There were more things bad about him
than this, but one is enough for a story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Uncle Wiggily hopped on and on, across the fields and
through the woods, and soon he came to the house of the bad
boy. It was a regular house, not a hollow stump bungalow,
such as that in which Mr. Longears lived.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there isn't any way of making that bad boy
good?" thought the bunny rabbit gentleman. "Bad boys
aren't of much use in the world, but good boys, or girls, who
put out crumbs for the hungry birds to eat in winter&mdash;they are
of great use in the world! I wonder if I could make that bad
boy good?"</p>

<p>But, no sooner had Uncle Wiggily began to wonder in this
fashion, than, all of a sudden, he heard a loud voice shouting:</p>

<p>"Hi! There he is! A rabbit! I'm going to throw a snowball
at him!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily looked over his shoulder and saw the bad
boy rushing out of his house, followed by another boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a nice, funny rabbit!" cried the second boy. "He
looks as if he came from a circus&mdash;all dressed up!"</p>

<p>"I'll make him turn a somersault if I can whang him with a
snowball!" shouted the bad boy, running toward the bunny
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better be going," said Uncle Wiggily, who
could understand boy and girl talk, though he could not speak
it himself. "I'll wait until some other day about trying to
make this boy good."</p>

<p>Mr. Longears started to run, but he had not taken many hops
before, all of a sudden, he felt a sharp, thumping pain in his
side, and he was almost knocked over by a snowball thrown
by the bad boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
"Hi there! I hit him! I hit him!" howled the bad boy,
dancing up and down.</p>

<p>"Yes," sadly said the other chap. "You hit him, but what
good did it do?"</p>

<p>"It shows I'm a straight shot!" proudly answered the other.
"Maybe I can catch that rabbit now."</p>

<p>He ran over the snow. But though Uncle Wiggily had
been knocked down by the ball thrown by the bad boy, the
rabbit gentleman managed to get to his feet, and away he
hopped on his rheumatism crutch&mdash;so fast that the bad boy
could not get him.</p>

<p>Then the bad boy and the other chap, who was not so bad,
played in the snow, until it was time to go home. Uncle Wiggily
hopped to his hollow stump bungalow, but he said nothing
to Nurse Jane about the pain in his side.</p>

<p>"If I tell her she won't let me go out to the movies to-night
with Grandpa Goosey," thought Mr. Longears.</p>

<p>So, though his side pained him, Uncle Wiggily said never a
word, but early that evening he hopped over to Grandpa
Goosey's home in the duck pen. And on the way Uncle Wiggily
had to pass the house of the bad boy.</p>

<p>"But it is getting dark, and he will not see me," thought the
bunny gentleman. "I guess it will be safe."</p>

<p>Now it happened that, just as Uncle Wiggily was hopping
under the window of the bad boy's house, the bunny heard
a voice inside saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! How my ear aches! Oh, what a pain! Can't
you do something to stop it, Mother?"</p>

<p>"If I had some soft cotton I could put a little warm oil on it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and that, in your ear, would make it feel better," answered
a lady's voice. "But I have no cotton in the house. If you'll
wait until I go to the drug store&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! No!" howled the voice of the bad boy. "I don't want
you to go to the store and leave me alone! Can't you get some
cotton without going to the store?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the mother. "You shouldn't have played
out in the cold, and thrown snowballs at the rabbit. You must
have gotten some snow in your ear to make it ache!"</p>

<p>"Oh, do something to make it stop!" cried the bad boy. "Oh,
why haven't we some cotton?"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily, outside under the window, heard all this
talk. Now the bunny gentleman knew where to find something
like cotton without going to the drug store. Inside each of
the big brown buds of the horse-chestnut tree is a little wad of
cotton. Mother Nature puts the cotton there to keep the bud
warm through the winter, so green leaves will come out in the
spring.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily looked around and saw, lying on the snow,
a branch which the wind had broken from a horse-chestnut tree.
Hopping across the newly-fallen spring snow to this branch,
Uncle Wiggily gnawed off some of the buds. Breaking these
open with his teeth, he took out some of the soft, fluffy
cotton.</p>

<p>"I'll just leave this on the bad boy's doorstep," thought the
bunny. "I'll tap with my crutch and hop away."</p>

<p>So the bunny gentleman, with the wad of cotton, skipped up
the front steps of the house when no one saw him. His paws
made funny little marks in the soft snow. Uncle Wiggily put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the cotton on the sill, tapped once, twice, three times with his
rheumatism crutch, and then hopped away.</p>

<p>"Somebody's at the door!" said the bad boy. "Maybe that's
daddy coming home, so he can go to the drug store and get that
cotton for my aching ear."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said his mother. "I hope it is."</p>

<p>She opened the door, and when she saw there the bunch of
cotton&mdash;just what she wanted&mdash;you can imagine how surprised
she was!</p>

<p>"Why, who could have left it?" asked the bad boy, when
his mother told him what had happened. "Who do you s'pose
did?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered. "But I saw some rabbit tracks
in the snow on our steps."</p>

<p>"Rabbit tracks?" repeated the boy, wonderingly, as his
mother softly put some warm cotton and oil in his ear, making
the pain almost stop.</p>

<p>"Yes, rabbit tracks," said Mother. "And, if I were you, I'd
never throw any more snowballs at rabbits."</p>

<p>The boy (I'll not call him bad any more) put his head down
on the pillow of his bed. He could go to sleep now, as the
pain in his ear had almost stopped.</p>

<p>"I wonder if that funny rabbit, dressed up like a little old
man, could have brought me the cotton?" said the boy.</p>

<p>"I wonder, too," softly spoke Mother with a smile.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I won't ever throw stones or snowballs at rabbits
any more," promised the boy.</p>

<p>"Or cats or dogs, either?" his mother asked.</p>

<p>"Or cats or dogs, either," added the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Then he went to sleep, and Uncle Wiggily, picking the bits
of fuzzy horse-chestnut tree cotton off his tall, silk hat, hopped
on to Grandpa Goosey's house and went to the movies.</p>

<p>So that's the story of the bunny gentleman and the bad boy,
and I hope you liked it. But if the rag doll's go-cart doesn't
race with the baby carriage and slip on the banana skin as
though it had on roller skates, I'll tell you in the next story
about Uncle Wiggily and the good boy.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GOOD BOY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Now do be careful to-day, please, Uncle Wiggily," begged
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper of
the bunny rabbit gentleman, as he hopped down off the steps
of his hollow stump bungalow one morning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/p032_650.jpg" width="650" height="438" alt="Now do be careful to-day." />
</div>

<p>"Careful? Why, I'm always careful," answered the bunny,
as he twinkled one side of his pink nose and looked to make
sure that his red, white and blue striped rheumatism crutch
was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
not painted green. "Don't you think so, Nurse Jane?"
asked Mr. Longears.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do not," Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy answered. "You
get so excited, looking for adventures, that you don't care
whether you are chased by the Pipsisewah or Skeezicks."</p>

<p>"But I always get away from them; don't I?" asked Uncle
Wiggily. "And the Woozie Wolf, the Fuzzy Fox and even
the Skillery Scallery Alligator. I always get away, Nurse
Jane."</p>

<p>"It is hard work for you, sometimes," said the muskrat lady.
"I do wish you would be more careful, Wiggy. Besides, these
new adventures of yours&mdash;helping real girls and boys out of
their troubles&mdash;are dangerous. Of course, I love children, and
I know you do, also. But some day you'll be caught by one of
these bad boys or girls."</p>

<p>"There aren't any bad girls," laughed Uncle Wiggily.
"They are just a bit funny; that's all. As for bad boys; well,
I hope to see them all turn good. And, anyhow, the children
love me so much I don't believe they'll harm me."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better be careful just the same," Nurse Jane
said. Then she went in to dust the dishes and sweep the furniture,
and Uncle Wiggily hopped over the fields and through
the woods, looking for an adventure.</p>

<p>The bunny gentleman had not gone far from his hollow
stump bungalow before he saw a crowd of boys on their way
to school. One of the boys had a tin can in his hand, and another
carried a piece of rope.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe those boys are going camping," thought Uncle
Wiggily, "and they're going to build a campfire and cook their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
carrot soup, or whatever they eat, in the tin can over the fire.
I'll hide in the bushes and watch them. And I can hear what
they say."</p>

<p>By means of a gift which a good fairy gave him, Uncle Wiggily,
for a time, was able to hear and understand the talk of
boys and girls, though he could not, himself, speak their language.
He wanted to hear what these boys would say, so the
bunny gentleman hid in the bushes.</p>

<p>The boys came along, laughing, shouting and trying to sing,
but that last they did not do as well as girls would have done.
Somehow or other, girls are better singers than boys.</p>

<p>Well, anyhow, the boys came nearer to where Uncle Wiggily
was hiding in the bushes, and, all of a sudden, one of the lads
gave a whoop like a wild Indian, and cried:</p>

<p>"There's a dog! Let's get him!"</p>

<p>"There, now!" thought Uncle Wiggily to himself. "I knew
boys were good. They want to take that dog with them to
camp and give him some of the soup they are going to boil
in the tin can. I hope they don't give it to him too hot, though,
and burn his tongue."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily peeked over the top of the bush, and saw one
of the boys chasing the dog. It was a little dog; rather thin,
so you could almost count his ribs, and he did not seem to have
had much to eat of late. And as soon as the dog saw the boy
running after him, that dog began to run also.</p>

<p>"Why, that's queer," said Uncle Wiggily. "Why does the
dog run away from that good boy? If I were only nearer I'd
tell the dog that the boy is going to be kind to him and give
him tomato-can camp-soup."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
"Oh, let the dog go!" called a red-haired boy to the one
who was running along with the tin can in his hand.</p>

<p>"No, I'm going to catch him and tie this tin can on his tail,"
the first boy answered. "You ought to see how fast he'll run
when he has this tin can on his tail!"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" thought Uncle Wiggily, hardly able to believe
what he heard. "Tie a tin can on a dog's tail! And I thought
that boy was going to be kind! Oh, oh, what a mistake I made!"</p>

<p>Most of the boys turned off on another path and went to
school, but the one with the tin can chased after the dog, and
another boy, who seemed very nice and quiet, stayed near the
bush, behind which Uncle Wiggily was hidden. Finally the
boy with the tin can caught the poor, thin, yelping dog, and
carried him back to the bush.</p>

<p>"Where's that piece of rope?" asked the bad boy, holding
the yelping, squirming little dog under one arm, while in the
other hand he carried the empty tin can.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the rope?" asked the quiet
boy. He held his hands behind his back.</p>

<p>"I'm going to use the rope to tie this tin can on the dog's
tail," answered the bad boy. "That's what I am!"</p>

<p>"Then I won't give it to you," spoke the quiet lad. "I'm not
going to let you tie any tin can to a dog's tail if I can help it!
There! You can't have the rope!"</p>

<p>With a sudden motion he threw, away over in the weeds,
the rope, which he had picked up after another lad had dropped
it to go to school.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! So that's what you're going to do, is it?" cried the
bad boy. "I'll fix you for that!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
He dropped his tin can; but still holding the poor dog under
his arm, the bad boy rushed at the quiet chap.</p>

<p>"I'll make you get that rope and help me tie the tin can on
this dog's tail!" cried the bad boy.</p>

<p>"I think it is about time for me to do something," said Uncle
Wiggily to himself. The bunny gentleman, hidden behind the
bush, had heard all that was said.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, just as the bad boy was going to hit the quiet
lad, for not helping to tie the tin can on the dog's tail, Uncle
Wiggily turned, and, in the soft sand and dirt, began to dig
very fast with his paws.</p>

<p>Now a rabbit gentleman is one of the best diggers in the
world. With his paws he can make himself a burrow, or underground
house, almost before you can eat a lollypop. And
Uncle Wiggily, pawing in the dirt, made a regular shower
of sand, gravel and little stones fly right in the face of the bad
boy.</p>

<p>By looking over his shoulder Uncle Wiggily could see which
way to dig so that the sand would go in the eyes of the bad boy,
but not in the face of the one who was kind to animals.</p>

<p>Whiff! Whiff! Whiff! the sand, gravel and little stones
shot over the top of the bushes, and spattered all over the bad
boy.</p>

<p>"Say! Who's doing that?" cried the unkind chap, trying
to hold his arm in front of his face to keep the sand out of his
eyes. "If you fellows don't stop that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>But he couldn't say any more, for a lot of sand went flying
into his mouth. He dropped the poor, thin dog, who ran away
and hid himself in a hollow tree, and then the bad boy had to
use both hands to wipe out the gravel that rattled down inside
his shirt, and so he couldn't hit the kind boy.</p>

<p>"Who's scattering that gravel?" cried the bad boy, scowling.</p>

<p>"I don't see anyone," said the other, smiling.</p>

<p>But there was Uncle Wiggily, behind the bush, scattering
the gravel with his paws in a regular shower.</p>

<p>"I wish Nurse Jane could see me now," chuckled the bunny
gentleman. "She surely would laugh."</p>

<p>At last so much gravel, sand and little stones showered into
the face of the bad boy that he ran away, crying:</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh! Something terrible must have happened!
I guess I'd better not tie any tin cans on dogs' tails any more."</p>

<p>"I guess you'd better not," said the other boy.</p>

<p>"And I say the same," laughed Uncle Wiggily, as he brushed
some dust off his tall, silk hat, and straightened his necktie.
Then the bunny gentleman watched, while the kind boy went
to the hollow tree and patted the poor, frightened little dog.
And then this boy hid the tin can where no other boys could
find it, and went on to school.</p>

<p>And I think&mdash;mind you I'm not sure&mdash;but I think that bad
boy turned good after that. Anyhow if he didn't he ought to.</p>

<p>"Well, I had quite an adventure," said the bunny rabbit
gentleman, as he hopped on to his hollow stump bungalow. "A
very good adventure!"</p>

<p>And if the jumping jack doesn't cut a slice off the mud pie
with the bread-knife, and tell the rag doll it's a piece of chocolate
cake, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily's valentine.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">STORY VI</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY'S VALENTINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily quickly hopped across the room and closed
the door of his hollow stump bungalow, where he was busy
in the sitting room. He heard Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy coming
along.</p>

<p>"Well, that's queer!" exclaimed the muskrat lady housekeeper,
as she noticed what Uncle Wiggily did. "I wonder
what he means? Wiggy," she called, "are you getting ready
for some strange, new adventure, such as stopping bad boys
from tying tin cans on dogs' tails?"</p>

<p>"Nothing like that now; no, my dear," answered the bunny
rabbit, and he quickly pulled the table cover over something
he had been looking at. "This is a secret!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;a secret!" exclaimed Nurse Jane, puzzled-like.</p>

<p>The muskrat lady looked at a calendar hanging on the wall,
and noticed that the day was February 14.</p>

<p>"I think I can guess what your secret is, Uncle Wiggily,"
she said to herself. "I s'pose it's something for Mrs. Twistytail,
the pig lady, or maybe for Grandpa Goosey Gander. Well,
I hope you enjoy it."</p>

<p>Then Nurse Jane went back to the dining room, where she
was giving the dishes their morning bath; and Uncle Wiggily
began to rustle some paper and tie knots in a piece of gold
string, the while murmuring to himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>"I hope she likes it! Oh, I do hope she likes it. I'll put it
on the steps, throw a stone at the door so she thinks someone
is knocking, and then I'll run and hide behind a bush and watch
how surprised she is when she opens it."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily had been very busy all that morning, after
having been out in the woods the day before. What he had
made I shall tell you about in a little while. Enough now for
you to know that the bunny rabbit had something he did not
want Nurse Jane to see.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, after opening the door a crack, and listening to
Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy wash the face of the clock, Uncle Wiggily
hopped softly out and down the front steps, with a box under
his paw. His tall silk hat was on rather sideways, and he carried
his red, white and blue striped rheumatism crutch upside
down, but when you remember that it was February 14, I think
you will kindly excuse the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily hopped on through the woods, and over the
fields. Every now and then he would stop, and, with his crutch,
brush to one side the dried leaves and little heaps of snow that
were scattered here and there in the forest.</p>

<p>"I hope I may find some," said Mr. Longears to himself. "It
won't be half so pretty without them. I hope I find some."</p>

<p>He searched in many places, and at last he found what he
was looking for. Carefully he picked something up off the
ground, and put it in the box he carried.</p>

<p>"Nurse Jane will surely like this," said the bunny gentleman.
He was about to hop on again when, all of a sudden, he
heard someone crying in the woods. There was a sobbing sound
and, looking around the corner of a tree, Uncle Wiggily saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
a little girl, sitting on a log. And she was crying as hard as
she could cry!</p>

<p>"That isn't the Freckled Girl," said the bunny gentleman to
himself. "She said she wouldn't mind her freckles after she
looked at the pretty speckled birds' eggs. It isn't the Freckled
Girl. I wonder who she is, and what's the matter?"</p>

<p>And pretty soon Uncle Wiggily found out, for he heard the
sobbing girl say:</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I had money enough to buy one! All the other
girls and boys can buy valentines to send teacher, but I can't!
And she'll think I don't like her, but I do! Oh, I wish I had a
valentine!"</p>

<p>"My goodness me sakes alive and some peanut pudding!"
whispered the bunny rabbit gentleman. "That girl is crying
because she hasn't a valentine for her teacher!"</p>

<p>Then the bunny gentleman looked down at the box, wrapped
in tissue paper, which he carried under his paw&mdash;the box in
which he had placed something he had found under the leaves
and snow of the forest a little while before.</p>

<p>"She wants a valentine," murmured the bunny rabbit gentleman.
"And here I have one that I made for Nurse Jane.
I was going to leave it on the steps and surprise my muskrat
lady housekeeper. But I suppose I could give it to this little
girl, and&mdash;well, Nurse Jane won't care, when I tell her."</p>

<p>"I'll do it! I'll give this girl my valentine," said Uncle
Wiggily so suddenly that his pink nose almost twinkled backward.</p>

<p>He looked over the top of a bush behind which he had sat
down to wrap up Nurse Jane's valentine. Then the bunny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
hopped over to the girl who sat on the log, still sobbing because
she had no token for her teacher.</p>

<p>The girl heard the rustling in the leaves, made by Uncle
Wiggily's paws as he hopped, and she looked up suddenly.
Then she rubbed her eyes, hardly able to believe what she saw.</p>

<p>"Why! Why!" she murmured. "Am I dreaming? Is this
a fairy? A rabbit gentleman, dressed in a tall silk hat, and
with his red, white and blue striped rheumatism crutch! Oh!
Why, it's Uncle Wiggily! It's Uncle Wiggily out of my Bedtime
Story Books! Oh, how glad I am to see you, dear Uncle
Wiggily! Please come up and sit by me on this log!"</p>

<p>But Uncle Wiggily was not allowed to do this. He put his
paw over his lips, to show that though he could hear, and understand
what the girl said, he could not talk to her in reply. Then
he placed his valentine beside her on the log and quickly hopped
away.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Wait a minute! Please wait a minute!"
cried the girl, but the bunny gentleman dared not
stay.</p>

<p>"I must try and find Nurse Jane another valentine," he said
to himself, as he skipped along the woodland paths.</p>

<p>Left alone, the girl on the log opened the box Uncle Wiggily
had left. It was made from pieces of white birch bark, such as
the Indians used for their canoes. Inside, were some sprigs
from an evergreen tree, with some round, brown buttons from
the sycamore tree. And in the middle of the evergreen sprigs
were some lovely pink and white blossoms of the trailing arbutus&mdash;the
earliest flower of Spring&mdash;growing under the leaves
and late snows. It was these arbutus flowers which the bunny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
had come to the woods to find and complete his valentine. Now
he had given it to the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely!" she murmured, tears no longer in her
eyes. "Won't teacher be surprised when I put this on her desk
and tell her Uncle Wiggily gave it to me? Oh, there's a verse,
too!"</p>

<p>And there was! Written on a piece of white birch bark,
which is what the animal folk use instead of paper, was this
little verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"These twigs of cedar, like my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Are ever green for you.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The blossoms whisper that I am<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Your Valentine so true!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I know teacher will just love this!" said the little girl, and
she was so excited she could hardly run to school. She had to
hop and skip.</p>

<p>"Here's a valentine Uncle Wiggily gave me in the woods,"
the little girl told her teacher, all excited and out of
breath.</p>

<p>"Uncle Wiggily? How strange!" exclaimed the teacher.
"I&mdash;I hope you didn't dream it," she said to the little girl.
"But, at any rate, the valentine is real. And how lovely! It's
the very nicest one I ever saw!"</p>

<p>Then you can imagine how pleased the little girl was. Uncle
Wiggily, hopping back to his bungalow through the woods,
gnawed a piece of white birch bark off a tree, and, with a
burned, black stick for a pencil, he scribbled on it:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear Nurse Jane: This is my valentine. I love you!"</p>

<p class="float right"><span class="smcap">"Uncle Wiggily."</span></p>

<p>And when the muskrat lady found that on the doorstep a
little later, she laughed and said it was the nicest valentine she
could wish for. And when Uncle Wiggily told about giving
the other valentine to the sad little girl, the muskrat lady said:</p>

<p>"You did just right, Wiggy! Now let's go to the movies!"</p>

<p>So they did. And if electric light doesn't cry when it has
to go down cellar in the dark, to get a piece of coal for the fire
to play with, you shall next hear about Uncle Wiggily and the
bad dog.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">STORY VII</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BAD DOG</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, about as many years ago as it takes a
lollypop to slide down the back cellar door, there lived in a
kennel, not far from Uncle Wiggily's hollow stump bungalow,
a bad dog. And the bunny rabbit gentleman, more than once,
wished that this dog would always stay in his kennel, or remain
chained in front of it so he couldn't get loose.</p>

<p>"For that dog," said Uncle Wiggily to Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, "is the pest of my life! Every time he sees me he
chases me. He isn't at all like Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow,
or Old Dog Percival."</p>

<p>"Why don't you scratch sand and gravel in his eyes as you
did in the face of the bad boy?" asked the muskrat lady housekeeper.</p>

<p>"You can't treat dogs as you do boys," replied Uncle Wiggily.
"Though, of course, some boys and some dogs are great
friends. But this dog seems always to want to chase me."</p>

<p>"Then you must be very careful if you go off in the woods
to-day, looking for an adventure," said Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

<p>"I will," promised the bunny rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>Away he hopped on his red, white and blue striped rheumatism
crutch, and his tall, silk hat. And this time Uncle Wiggily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
took with him his glasses,  which he sometimes wore in order to
see better.</p>

<p>"And I want to see the very best I can to-day," said Mr.
Longears to himself, as he hopped along. "I want to see that
bad, unpleasant dog before he sees me!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was skipping along, thinking perhaps that
he had better pick a bunch of violets and take them to the lady
mouse teacher in the hollow stump school, when, all of a sudden,
there sounded through the woods a loud:</p>

<p>"Wuff! Wuff!"</p>

<p>"That isn't the Fox, nor yet the Wolf, nor even the Skillery
Scallery Alligator," said Uncle Wiggily, looking around the
corner of the mulberry bush. "I think it must be that savage
dog!"</p>

<p>And, surely enough it was. And a moment later the dog
came bursting through the bushes, barking and growling and
headed straight for Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"I'll make believe I'm playing baseball and try for a home
run!" said the rabbit gentleman to himself, and through the
bushes, turning and twisting this way and that, he ran for his
hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily reached it only just in time, too. For as he
hopped up the steps, and closed the door, locking it, the dog
jumped over the gate.</p>

<p>"My goodness me sakes alive and a basket of soap bubbles!"
cried Nurse Jane. "What's the matter, Wiggy? Is the house
on fire?"</p>

<p>"It's that dog&mdash;chasing&mdash;me!" panted the bunny, for he was
quite out of breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>"The idea! How impolite of him!" exclaimed the muskrat
lady, and she shook her broom out of the window at the bad
chap.</p>

<p>"Well, you got away from me this time, but the next time
I'll get you," growled the dog, as he slunk away.</p>

<p>"Why is he so anxious to catch you?" asked Nurse Jane, as
Uncle Wiggily sat down in an easy chair to rest.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess he'd chase any of the animal folk he saw in the
wood," answered the bunny gentleman. "He'd chase Sammie
or Susie Littletail the rabbits, Johnnie or Billie Bushytail the
squirrels and I'm sure he would make Lulu, Alice and Jimmie
Wibblewobble, the duck children, lose their feathers in trying
to flutter away from him."</p>

<p>"It's too bad," said Nurse Jane. "You ought to speak to
Old Percival, the Policeman Dog about this bad chap."</p>

<p>"I shall," said Uncle Wiggily. He did, too, but the bad dog
was so sly that Old Percival could not catch him. Uncle Wiggily
also spoke to the little dog, whom he had saved from having
a tin can tied on his tail by a bad boy.</p>

<p>"I'll tell this savage dog to let you alone," the little chap
promised.</p>

<p>But all this did no good. Every time the bad dog saw Uncle
Wiggily in the woods he chased the rabbit gentleman, and once
nearly caught the bunny. I don't know why this dog was so
unpleasant and mean toward Uncle Wiggily. I guess maybe
the dog didn't know any better. Perhaps he thought Uncle
Wiggily didn't like dogs, but Mr. Longears did&mdash;especially
Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the little puppy chaps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>Well, as it happened, one day the people who owned the
big, savage dog, that always chased Uncle Wiggily, went away
on a visit. And they went in such a hurry that they left the
dog chained to his kennel, and they forgot to leave him any
water to drink, or food to eat.</p>

<p>At first the dog was not hungry, but later in the day, when
it was time for him to have had a meal, and some water, that
dog began to feel very unhappy.</p>

<p>"Bow! Wow! Wow!" he barked, trying to call someone
out to feed him, and pour water in the sun-dried pan. But no
one came, and the dog grew more hungry, and so thirsty that
his tongue hung down out of his mouth.</p>

<p>Just about this time Uncle Wiggily was going through the
woods on his way to the six and seven cent store to get Nurse
Jane a spool of thread. The bunny rabbit heard the barking
of the dog, and started to run, for he knew that voice. But as
he paused to listen, and find out from which direction the sound
came, so he could run away from it, instead of toward it, Uncle
Wiggily heard a voice saying:</p>

<p>"Bow wow! Oh, how hungry I am! How thirsty I am!"</p>

<p>It was the savage dog speaking, and Uncle Wiggily of course
understood animal talk, even better than he had learned to
know, as he had of late, what boys and girls said.</p>

<p>"Hum! So that dog is hungry and thirsty, is he?" said the
bunny to himself. "Well, why doesn't he go and dig up some
of the bones he must have buried? And why doesn't he go to
the duck pond and get a drink, I wonder?"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily thought there was something strange about
this, and as the barking and animal-talking voice of the dog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
did not come any nearer, the bunny hopped over to see what
was the matter.</p>

<p>There he saw the savage dog, fastened by a heavy chain to
his kennel, with nothing to eat, no water to drink and no one
to bring him any.</p>

<p>"Oh, how hungry I am! How thirsty I am!" barked the dog.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/p048_650.jpg" width="650" height="482" alt="Oh are you? politely asked Uncle Wiggily" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, are you?" politely asked Uncle Wiggily, looking out
from behind a stone. He was not afraid to be this near the
bad dog, for the savage chap was chained, and could not get
loose.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am very thirsty and hungry," whined the dog. "But
of course I don't expect you to feed me or give me water. I've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
been too bad to you&mdash;I've chased you too often! I can't ask
you to help me!"</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," said Uncle Wiggily politely. "If I
were ill in my bungalow, with rheumatism, and Nurse Jane
wasn't there to wait on me, and you came along, wouldn't you
get me a drink of water?"</p>

<p>The dog thought a moment before answering. Then he sort
of drooped his tail, sorry-like and softly said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe I would."</p>

<p>"Then," said the bunny gentleman, "I'll bring you a drink,
and if you tell me where you have buried some bones, I'll dig
them up for you, since I can't loosen your kennel chain to let
you dig them yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind you are!" said the dog. "I&mdash;I really don't
deserve this."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" laughed Uncle Wiggily. "We all
make mistakes&mdash;that's why they put rubbers on the end of lead
pencils, as someone has said. I'll help you when you're in
trouble."</p>

<p>Then the bunny found a half a cocoanut shell, and dipping
this in the nearby brook, brought water to the thirsty dog. And
when he had taken a long drink, cooling his parched and hot
tongue, the dog pointed to where he had buried some bones,
behind the barn.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily dug up the bones with his paws, which were
just made for such work, and carried them to the dog.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't thank you enough," said Gurr-Rup, which was
the dog's name. "And I promise, Mr. Longears, that I'll never
chase you again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you!" laughed the bunny, as he hopped on to the
three and four cent store. "I hoped you wouldn't."</p>

<p>So this teaches us that it doesn't hurt the needle to put the
thread in its eye, and if the apple doesn't jump out of the
dumpling, and try to hide in the chocolate cake, when it ought
to take the pie to the moving pictures, on the next page you
will find a story about Uncle Wiggily and Puss in Boots.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">STORY VIII</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND PUSS IN BOOTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Where are you going, Uncle Wiggily?" called Nurse Jane
Fuzzy one day, as the muskrat lady saw the bunny gentleman
hopping away from his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>"I am going to get myself a new pair of rubber boots," said
Mr. Longears. "My old ones are wearing out, and they have
little holes in, so they leak. We have had so much rain, of late,
that I will need a new pair of boots if I am to look for any
more adventures. So I am going to the shoemaker's."</p>

<p>"But why are you taking your old boots along?" asked Nurse
Jane, for Uncle Wiggily had them under his paw.</p>

<p>"I am taking them to the shoemaker to show him what size
I want my new boots," answered the bunny. "Also he may be
able to mend these old ones so they will do to wear in the
garden."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," said Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy. "And while
you are out I wish you would go to the seven and eight cent
store for me. I want some needles and thread, some balls of
red yarn and some white flannel."</p>

<p>"My! All that! Are you going to make a bedquilt?" asked
the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"No," laughed Nurse Jane. "I am going to use the white
flannel to make me a new petticoat, the red yarn I am going
to use to knit Sammie and Susie Littletail, the rabbit children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
some mittens, and the needle and thread I will use to sew up
a hole in the lace curtain."</p>

<p>"Very well," spoke Uncle Wiggily politely, "you shall have
all three, and I'll get myself a new pair of boots."</p>

<p>It did not take the bunny rabbit gentleman long to hop to
the shop of the Monkey Doodle shoemaker, where Mr. Longears
bought himself a new pair of rubber boots.</p>

<p>"As for those old ones," said the Monkey chap, "I can mend
them for you, so they will do to wear many times yet."</p>

<p>"Please do so," begged the bunny. And when his old boots
were mended he carried them over his shoulder with the new
ones, for he was wearing his shoes. Along he hopped to the
seven and eight cent store.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily bought the needles, thread, white flannel and
red yarn for the rabbit children's mittens, and he was hopping
back to his hollow stump bungalow, when, all of a sudden,
coming from behind a sassafras bush, he heard a voice saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! How sad! Now I suppose they'll take me out
of all the story books, and the children will never love me any
more!"</p>

<p>"Hum! This is strange," said Uncle Wiggily to himself.
"I wonder who it is that can't be in the story books any more?
That is very sad! I wouldn't want them to put me out of all the
Bedtime Story Books in which I have my adventures."</p>

<p>So the bunny gentleman looked around the corner of a lollypop
bush, and there he saw a cat, dressed in a coat, trousers
and cap, but without anything on his hind paws, sitting on a
stump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Cat!" politely greeted Uncle Wiggily.
"You seem to be in trouble."</p>

<p>"I am," was the answer. "Only my name is Puss, and not
Cat, though, of course, that's what I really am. Puss in Boots
is my right name, but there is no use trying to keep it
any longer."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Uncle Wiggily asked.</p>

<p>"Because I have lost my boots," answered Puss. "A little
while ago I met a cross dog who chased me. I ran across a swamp
and became stuck in the mud. I managed to pull my paws out
of the boots, but the boots themselves remained fast in the mud.
Now I have no boots and I can be called Puss in Boots no
longer! I shall have to keep out of all the story books!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 615px;">
<img src="images/p053_650.jpg" width="615" height="432" alt="I have lost my boots answered Puss" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p>"Nonsense!" laughed Uncle Wiggily. "Why, I have two
pairs of boots here! Take one of them, I can only wear one
pair of boots at a time," and very politely Mr. Longears gave
his new boots to the cat.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can't take your new boots!" objected Puss. "The
old ones will do me very well."</p>

<p>"No," kindly insisted Uncle Wiggily. "Please take the new
ones. Since my old ones were mended they will answer me
very well, and they'll be easier on my paws."</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily gave Puss the new boots, keeping the old
mended ones for himself, and as the cat put the boots on his
paws he looked just as he ought to&mdash;like his pictures in the
story books.</p>

<p>"Now I can keep my place, the children will not miss me.
Thank you, Uncle Wiggily," mewed Puss.</p>

<p>"Pray do not mention it," said the bunny. "I am glad I don't
have to carry two pairs of boots."</p>

<p>So Mr. Longears hopped on a little farther, and soon he heard
some tiny voices saying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Oh, Mother dear! Look here! Look here!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Our mittens we have lost!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ho! I should know who they are!" said the bunny. "Those
must be the three kittens!"</p>

<p>And, surely enough, they were, as the bunny saw a moment
later, when he turned around the corner of a mulberry tree.
There were three little pussy kittens, holding up their paws
for their mother to see, and there wasn't a single mitten on
any one of the paws! What do you think of that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"What, lost your mittens! You careless kittens!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now you can't have any pie!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus sang the mother cat. And when the three little kittens,
who had lost their mittens, began to cry, Uncle Wiggily felt
so sorry for them that he stepped up and said:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Cat. But I have a lot of red yarn I bought
for Nurse Jane to knit mittens for Sammie and Susie Littletail.
There is more than Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy needs, I'm sure, so I
shall give you some to knit mittens for your pussies."</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind you are!" mewed the mother cat, as Uncle
Wiggily gave her three balls of red yarn, still leaving plenty
for the rabbit children's mittens. "Now you may have some
pie, and I'll give Uncle Wiggily a piece, too," said the cat
mother to her kittens.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," remarked Mr. Longears. "But I must
hop on with the needle and thread, and the piece of white flannel
Nurse Jane is going to use to make herself a new petticoat."</p>

<p>So on hopped the bunny, while the mother cat sat down to
knit some new mittens for her kittens. And Uncle Wiggily
had not gone very far before, all of a sudden, he heard another
sad mewing sound and a voice said:</p>

<p>"Dear me! The hole goes all the way through! I shall
never be able to go to see Old Mother Hubbard this way! Oh,
what an accident!"</p>

<p>"That sounds like more trouble," thought Uncle Wiggily,
and, looking over the top of a stone wall, he saw a pussy cat
lady sitting on a stump, sadly looking at her skirt.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Mr. Longears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh! How you surprised me!" mewed the cat lady. "But
here is the trouble. I'm Pussy Cat Mole. I jumped over a
coal, and in my best petticoat burned a great hole!" and she
showed the edge of her petticoat where, surely enough, a hole
was burned through.</p>

<p>"And I ought to be at Mother Hubbard's now, to go with
her to the movies," said Pussy Cat Mole. "But, alas, I can
not go!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can!" said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Not with this big burned hole in my petticoat!" mewed the
cat.</p>

<p>"Ah, but you shall sew on a patch," said the bunny. "I have
here needle and thread, and some white flannel. Can't you
mend your best petticoat with all those?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I can," mewed Pussy Cat Mole. "Thank you, so
much!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily gave her a needle and thread, and with her
claws Miss Mole tore off a piece of white flannel, for there
was more than Nurse Jane needed. She sewed the patch neatly
on, and then, with her petticoat nicely mended, Pussy Cat Mole
went on to Mother Hubbard's.</p>

<p>"Ah, how delightful it is to be helpful," said Uncle Wiggily,
as he hopped back to his bungalow. And he was very glad he
had met the three cats, one after another. For a little later that
day the bad Woozie Wolf chased the bunny.</p>

<p>But the mother of the three kittens, after she had knit their
mittens, tickled the wolf with her knitting needles. Puss with
the boots, stepped on the wolf's tail so hard that he cried
"Ouch!" And Pussy Cat Mole ran at the wolf with a piece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
red stone, which she pretended was a red hot coal that in her
best petticoat had burned a great hole.</p>

<p>"I'll burn you! I'll burn you!" she mewed at the wolf.</p>

<p>"Then this is no place for me!" he howled, and away he ran,
not hurting the bunny at all. And how the bunny gentleman
and the three cats laughed!</p>

<p>So if the elephant from the Noah's Ark doesn't drop a cold
penny down the back of the gold fish and make it sneeze, the
next story is going to be about Uncle Wiggily and the lost boy.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">STORY IX</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LOST BOY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"There goes that boy out again, flying his kite," said Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, as she looked from the window of the
hollow stump bungalow one morning.</p>

<p>"What boy?" Uncle Wiggily wanted to know.</p>

<p>"The new boy who has just moved into the red brick house,"
answered the muskrat lady housekeeper. "I hope he isn't a bad
boy, who will chase you, Uncle Wiggily, and come to the forest
to play tricks on Sammie and Susie Littletail, and the other
animal boys and girls."</p>

<p>"Oh, he doesn't look like that kind of a boy," said the bunny
rabbit gentleman, as he sat down to eat his breakfast of carrot
pancakes with turnip maple sugar gravy sprinkled down the
middle. "But I'll be careful until I get to know him better."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily's hollow stump bungalow had lately been
rebuilt near the edge of a wood, and, just beyond the thicket of
trees and tangle of bushes was a small town, where lived many
boys and girls.</p>

<p>Only a few of these boys and girls knew about the bunny
rabbit gentleman, and his muskrat lady nurse, and those who
did were kind to Uncle Wiggily, because the rabbit gentleman
had been kind to them, doing them many favors.</p>

<p>But now that a new boy had moved into the red brick house,
Uncle Wiggily felt that he must not hop around in too lively a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
fashion, until he found out whether the boy was bad or good.
For there are some bad boys, you know.</p>

<p>"He seems quiet enough," said Nurse Jane, as she spread
some lettuce marmalade on a slice of bread for Uncle Wiggily.
"He sits there flying his kite. I guess it will be safe for you
to go to the store for me, Wiggy."</p>

<p>"What do you want from the store?" asked the bunny gentleman,
as he took his tall, silk hat down off the piano. Sometimes
he went to the store quite dressed up. At other times he
would put on an old cap and overalls, just as he came from the
garden.</p>

<p>"I want another ball of red yarn," Nurse Jane answered. "I
did not have quite enough to knit the mittens for Sammie and
Susie, the rabbit children."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's because I gave some of the yarn to the three
little kittens who lost their mittens," said the bunny, twinkling
his pink nose upside down, to make sure it would not fall off
as he hopped along.</p>

<p>"Well, that's one of the reasons," Nurse Jane answered.
"But I'm glad you helped the little kittens. You can easily
get me another ball of yarn."</p>

<p>"Of course," Uncle Wiggily agreed, and soon he was hopping
over the fields and through the woods, on his way to the
store. Not one of the stores where the boys and girls bought
their toys and lollypops, but a special animal store, kept by a
Monkey Doodle gentleman.</p>

<p>And as Uncle Wiggily hopped along under the bushes, near
the house of the Kite Boy, the bunny heard the boy's mother
say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't go away and get lost, Buddie!"</p>

<p>"No'm, I won't!" promised the boy, as he held his kite string
in his hand and watched his toy fly high in the air.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily stopped for a moment, underneath a big
burdock plant, and looked at Buddie, which was the boy's pet
name. Buddie could not see the rabbit gentleman. If he had,
Buddie would have been much surprised to notice a bunny with
glasses and a tall silk hat.</p>

<p>The wind blew the kite higher into the air, and Uncle Wiggily
thought of the many times he had helped Johnnie and
Billie Bushytail, the squirrels, fly their kites, and how he had,
more than once, made kites for Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the
puppy dog boys.</p>

<p>Then the bunny gentleman hopped on to the store to get
the ball of red yarn for Nurse Jane. He stayed some little
time, Mr. Longears did, for he met Grandfather Goosey Gander,
and talked to the old gentleman duck about rheumatism,
and what to do when you sneezed too much.</p>

<p>But finally Uncle Wiggily started back for his hollow stump
bungalow, and soon he was in the middle of the wood, about
half way home. And all of a sudden the bunny gentleman
heard a crying voice saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I don't know where my home is! I'm
lost! Oh, dear! I'm lost!"</p>

<p>Mr. Longears peered through the bushes, and there he saw
the boy from the red brick house, who held in his hand a broken
kite.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see what has happened!" said the bunny. "His kite
broke loose from the string. Forgetting what he promised his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
mother, about not going away, the boy ran after his kite, over
into the woods, and now he is lost. I wonder if I can help him
find his way home?"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily did not show himself yet. Hiding behind
the bushes, the bunny followed the lost boy as he wandered
about among the trees, not knowing which way to go.</p>

<p>"Oh, where is my house?" said the boy over and over again.
"Why can't I find it?"</p>

<p>Then a mournful voice cried:</p>

<p>"Woo! Woo! Woo!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! What's that?" exclaimed the lost boy, suddenly
stopping.</p>

<p>"It's only an owl bird," said Uncle Wiggily to himself. He
wished he might speak to the boy, and tell him this, but though
the bunny could understand boy-talk, the boy couldn't understand
rabbit language.</p>

<p>The Kite Boy went on a little farther, and then he heard a
rustling in the dried leaves.</p>

<p>"Oh-o-o-o!" gasped the lost boy. "Maybe that's a snake!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" laughed Uncle Wiggily to himself. "It is only
a brown thrush bird, scattering the leaves to look for something
to eat. And, even if it were a snake it wouldn't hurt the boy.
I wish I might tell him so."</p>

<p>The boy wandered along a little farther, and suddenly there
boomed out through the forest a sound of:</p>

<p>"Ga-rump! Ga-roomp! Ga-Zing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe that's a giant!" cried the boy, dropping his broken
kite.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed Uncle Wiggily. "That's only Grandpa

Croaker, the big bull frog who tells such funny stories to
Bully and Bawly No-Tail, the frog boys! How Grandpa
Croaker will laugh when I tell him the lost boy thought him a
giant! But I must help this boy out of the woods, or his mother
will be worried."</p>

<p>"Let me see, how can I do it without letting him see me?
Ha! I have it. This ball of red yarn. I'll hop to the edge
of the wood, near his house, and fasten one end of the red yarn
to a tree there. Then I'll come back, unwinding the ball on
the way, and when I get to the boy, I'll toss him what is left
of the ball. Then all he'll have to do will be to follow the red
cord right to his house."</p>

<p>No sooner said than done! Uncle Wiggily knew his way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
through the forest, even in the dark, and he soon reached the
edge of the wood and saw the boy's red brick house.</p>

<p>Then, tying one end of the red yarn to the bush near where
the boy had been sitting to fly his kite, Uncle Wiggily turned
back, unrolling the ball as he hopped along. He soon came
to the lost boy again, and the poor little chap was crying harder
than ever.</p>

<p>Over the bush and at the feet of the boy, the bunny tossed
the little ball of yarn that remained.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's that?" cried Buddie, almost ready to jump out
of his skin. But when he saw the little red ball, and the red
string stretching off through the trees, he was no longer afraid.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe this is a fairy string, and will lead me home!"
he joyfully cried, as he began to follow it. And, though we
know it wasn't a fairy string, still it was just as good, for it
led the boy home, as he followed the yarn, winding up the ball
as he walked along. And, oh, how fast he ran when he came
within sight of his house, crying, as he dropped the ball:</p>

<p>"Here I am, Mother! Here I am. I'm not lost any more!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad of that," Mother answered. "You shouldn't
have gone into the woods. I was just coming to look for you."</p>

<p>"Well," whispered Uncle Wiggily to himself, "I'm glad I
could be of some help in this world." Then the rabbit, who
had followed the lost boy until Buddie found his home, wound
up the red yarn again, and took it to Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"My! That was quite an adventure," said the muskrat lady
when the bunny gentleman told her about it. And if the boiled
egg doesn't try to go sailing in the gravy boat, and splash condensed
milk on the bread-knife, I'll tell you on the page after
this about Uncle Wiggily and Stubby Toes.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X">STORY X</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND STUBBY TOES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There are some children who are always stubbing their toes
and falling down. That was what happened, far too often, to
the little boy in this story. And I am going to tell you how
Uncle Wiggily helped cure him.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may think it strange that an old rabbit gentleman,
with a pink, twinkling nose and a tall, silk hat could cure
a boy of stubbing his toes. But this only goes to show that
you never can tell what is going to happen in this world.</p>

<p>So we shall start by saying that, once upon a time, there was
a boy who slipped and stumbled so often that he was called
"Stubby Toes."</p>

<p>Stubby Toes was not a very big boy. In fact, one of the
reasons he stubbed his toe so often (first the big toe of one foot,
and then the big toe of the other foot), the reason, I say, was
because he was so small. He had not yet grown up so that he
knew how to step over things that lay in his path, causing him
to stumble.</p>

<p>Why, sometimes that boy would stumble over a pin on the
sidewalk. And again I have known him to trip and almost
fall because he saw, in his way, a leaf from a tree.</p>

<p>"Upsi-daisey!" his sister would cry as she caught him by the
hand, so he would not fall. "Upsi-daisey, Stubby Toes!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>It was Sister who really gave Stubby Toes his name, but she
was only in fun, of course.</p>

<p>Well, one day when Uncle Wiggily had started out of his
hollow stump bungalow to look for an adventure, Sister took
her little brother Stubby Toes for a walk. And, as it happened,
the path taken by Sister and Stubby Toes stretched along
through the woodland where the bunny gentleman lived.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go see Baby Bunty to-day," said Uncle Wiggily
to himself, as he hopped along, twinkling his pink nose in the
sunshine. "I have a little touch of the rheumatism, and Baby
Bunty is so lively, always playing tag, or something like that
in the way of games, that she'll make me spry, and chase the
pain away."</p>

<p>But as the bunny gentleman came near the place where the
little boy and his sister were walking, all of a sudden Stubby
Toes tripped over a little stone, about as large as the end of
your lollypop stick, and&mdash;down he almost fell!</p>

<p>"Upsi-daisey!" cried Sister as she pulled Brother to his feet.
"Upsi-daisey!"</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! Boo hoo! I&mdash;I stubbed my toe!" cried the little
boy.</p>

<p>"Of course you did!" said Sister, laughing.</p>

<p>I think I forgot to tell you that Stubby Toes often cried
when he slipped this way. Yes, almost every time he cried, and
Sister wished he wouldn't, and so did Mother.</p>

<p>"Boo hoo! Boo hoo!" the boy wailed. "I bunked myself!"</p>

<p>Sister laughed and recited this little verse, which is a good
one to sing whenever anything happens. It is a verse I read
once, many years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Oh, fie,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Do not cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If you stub your toe.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Say 'Oh!'<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And let it go.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Be a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If you can,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And do not cry!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After Sister had sung this for Brother, she wiped away his
tears, which just started to trickle down his cheeks, and they
walked on again.</p>

<p>"This is a good little girl," said Uncle Wiggily to himself,
for, hidden in the bushes he had heard and seen all that went
on. "I wish I could teach Stubby Toes not to stumble so much.
I wonder how I can? I'll ask Baby Bunty about it."</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily hopped on to Baby Bunty's bungalow,
and, meanwhile Brother and Sister walked through the woods.</p>

<p>Well, I wish you could have seen what happened to Stubby
Toes! But, no! Perhaps, on second thought, it is better that
you did not. But, oh! So many times as he almost fell!</p>

<p>He tripped over a little baby angle worm, who was crawling
to the store to get a loaf of cake for his mother. And next
Stubby Toes almost landed on his nose, because the shadow of
a bird flitted across his path.</p>

<p>"Oh, Stubby Toes!" cried Sister, as she kept him from falling
on his face. "Will you ever learn to walk without stumbling?"</p>

<p>"Boo hoo!" was all that Stubby Toes answered, for, just then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
he tripped over a blade of grass, and this time he fell down all
the way. Only he happened to land on some soft, green moss,
so he was not much hurt, I'm glad to say.</p>

<p>"This is too bad!" Uncle Wiggily said to himself, for he had
heard and seen it all. "I must get Baby Bunty to teach this
little chap how to walk more carefully."</p>

<p>It was not far to the home of Baby Bunty. That little rabbit
girl was out skipping her rope in front of her house.</p>

<p>"Tag, Uncle Wiggily! You're it!" she cried, as soon as she
saw the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"Tut! Tut! We have no time for a game now," said Mr.
Longears. "I want you to come with me, Baby Bunty, and
teach Stubby Toes a lesson," and he told about the little
boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see what you mean," said Baby Bunty. "You want
me to hop along in front of him, and show him how not to stub
his toe."</p>

<p>"That's it!" said Uncle Wiggily. "Stubby Toes and Sister
are kind to animals and will not harm us."</p>

<p>So, a little later, Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty were walking
along the woodland path just ahead of the little boy and
his sister.</p>

<p>"Now, Baby Bunty," said Mr. Longears, "show this boy how
nicely you can hop along, even if there are sticks and stones on
the path."</p>

<p>Away skipped the little rabbit girl. She came to a stone, but
over it she stepped as nicely as you please. She reached a stick,
but she gave a hop, and there she was on the other side! And
she never stubbed her toe once, because she was careful!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>By this time the little boy and his sister had seen Uncle Wiggily
and Baby Bunty.</p>

<p>"Oh, look at the funny rabbits!" cried Stubby Toes. "I want
to catch 'em!"</p>

<p>"No! No! Mustn't touch!" said Sister, and she reached
out to catch hold of Stubby Toes, but it was too late! He
tripped his foot on a dandelion blossom in the grass, and down
he went!</p>

<p>"Boo hoo!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, fie!" said Sister, singing the little verse again. "Look
at the baby rabbit! She doesn't stub her toes!"</p>

<p>And, surely enough, Baby Bunty, skipping along on the path
in front of Stubby Toes, never fell once. She skipped over
pebbles and stones, sticks and clumps of grass, and never once
stepped on a flower.</p>

<p>"See if you can't do that, Stubby Toes!" begged Sister.</p>

<p>And of course that boy didn't want a little baby rabbit girl
to walk better than he did. So he dried his tears, stood up
straight and began to walk more firmly, watching where he set
down his feet.</p>

<p>He came to a big stone and&mdash;over it he stepped without
stumbling. He reached a stick&mdash;and, over that he put both
feet without falling! He passed a lump of dirt&mdash;and right
over it he JUMPED&mdash;and he didn't stub his toe once! What
do you think of that?</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not going to call you Stubby Toes any more!"
laughed Sister. "Now you have learned to walk as well as that
baby rabbit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>Uncle Wiggily laughed so hard that his tall silk hat almost
slipped down over his pink, twinkling nose.</p>

<p>"I think we have done enough, Baby Bunty," he said,
"Come on now, and I'll buy you a carrot lollypop!"</p>

<p>Away hopped the bunnies, and back home went Sister and
Brother who was Stubby Toes no longer. Baby Bunty had
taught him a good lesson.</p>

<p>And if the jumping jack doesn't fall off his stick when he is
trying to play hop scotch with the bean bag, you shall next
hear about Uncle Wiggily's Christmas.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY'S CHRISTMAS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Down swirled the snow, its white flakes blown by the cold
December wind. From the North it came, this wind; and a
bird&mdash;not a robin, for they had long ago flown South&mdash;a bird
went in the barn, and hid his head under his wing, poor thing!</p>

<p>It was cold in the woods around Uncle Wiggily's hollow
stump bungalow, and the rabbit gentleman brought in stick
after stick of wood for Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy to pile on the
blazing fire that roared up the chimney.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily, having filled the wood box, took his cap, and
his fur-lined coat down from the rack.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Wiggy! You aren't going out on a day like this,
are you?" asked Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the bunny gentleman, "I am, if you please,
Nurse Jane. I promised Grandfather Goosey Gander I'd go
down town shopping with him. He wants to look through the
five and ten cent stores to see what they have for Christmas."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if it's about Christmas, that's different," said the
muskrat lady. "But wrap yourself up well, for it is storming
hard. I don't want you to take cold."</p>

<p>"Nor do I want a cold," said Uncle Wiggily. "My pink nose
gets very red when I sneeze. I'll be careful, Nurse Jane."</p>

<p>Out into the snowy, blowy woods went Uncle Wiggily. He
passed the burrow-house where Sammie and Susie Littletail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the rabbit children, lived. Susie was at the window and waved
her paw to the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"Only three more days until Christmas! Aren't you glad,
Uncle Wiggily?" called Susie.</p>

<p>"Indeed I am," answered Mr. Longears. "Very glad!"</p>

<p>Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels, looked from the
window of their house. Johnnie held up a string of nuts that
he was getting ready to put on the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>"Billie and I are going to help Santa Claus!" chattered
Johnnie.</p>

<p>"Good!" laughed Uncle Wiggily. "Santa Claus needs
help!"</p>

<p>The bunny hopped along through the snow until he reached
the kennel of Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy dog
boys.</p>

<p>"We're popping corn!" barked Jackie. "Getting ready for
Christmas! That's why we can't be out!"</p>

<p>"Stay in the house and keep warm!" called Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>He hopped on a little farther until he met Mr. Gander, and
the rabbit gentleman and the goose grandpa made their way
through the five and ten, the three and four and the sixteen
and seventeen cent stores. Each place was piled full of Christmas
presents for animal boys and girls, and animal fathers and
mothers were shopping about, to tell Santa Claus what to bring
to the different houses, you know.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily saw some things he knew Nurse Jane would
like, and Grandpa Goosey bought some presents that had come
directly from the workshop of Santa Claus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Then along came Mr. Whitewash, the Polar Bear gentleman.</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho!" roared Mr. Whitewash, in his jolly voice.
"Come to my ice cave, gentlemen, and have a cup of hot, melted
icicles!"</p>

<p>"I'd like to, but I can't," said Uncle Wiggily. "Nurse Jane
wanted me to get her some spools of thread. I'll buy them and
go back to my bungalow."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go with you, Mr. Whitewash," quacked Grandpa
Goosey, and he waddled off with the bear gentleman, while
Uncle Wiggily, having bought the thread, hopped toward his
bungalow.</p>

<p>The bunny uncle had not gone very far before he heard some
children talking behind a bush around which the snow was piled
in a high drift. Uncle Wiggily could hide behind this drift
and hear what was said.</p>

<p>"Is Santa Claus coming to your house?" asked one boy of
another.</p>

<p>"I don't guess so," was the answer. "My father said our
chimney was so full of black soot that Santa Claus couldn't get
down. He'd look like a charcoal man if he did, I guess."</p>

<p>"It's the same way at our house," sighed the first boy. "Our
chimney is all stopped up. I guess there'll be no Christmas
presents this year."</p>

<p>"My! That's too bad!" thought Uncle Wiggily to himself.
"There ought to be a Christmas for everyone, and a little thing
like a soot-filled chimney ought not to stand in the way. All
the animal children whom I know are going to get presents. I
wish I could help these boys. And they probably have sisters,
also, who will get nothing for Christmas. Too bad!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily peered over the top of the snowbank. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
saw the boys, but they did not notice the rabbit, and Mr. Longears
knew where the boys lived. Their homes were in houses
near the brick one, where dwelt the lad who was once lost in
the woods. Uncle Wiggily unwound a ball of red yarn, if you
will kindly remember, and by following this the Kite Boy
found his house.</p>

<p>"I wish I could help those boys who are not going to have
any Christmas," said the bunny gentleman to himself, as he
hopped on with Nurse Jane's spools of thread.</p>

<p>And just then, in the air overhead, he heard the sounds of:</p>

<p>"Caw! Caw! Caw!"</p>

<p>"Crows!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "My friends the black
crows! They stay here all winter. Black crows&mdash;black&mdash;black&mdash;why,
a chimney is black inside, just as a crow is black outside!
I'm beginning to think of something! Yes, that's what I am!"</p>

<p>The rabbit's pink nose began twinkling very fast. It always
did when he was thinking, and now it was sparkling almost like
a star on a frosty night.</p>

<p>"Ha! I have it!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "A crow can
become no blacker inside a sooty chimney than outside! If
Santa Claus can't go down a black chimney, why a crow can!
I'll have these crows pretend to be St. Nicholas!"</p>

<p>No sooner thought of than done! Uncle Wiggily put his
paws to his lips and sent out a shrill whistle, just as a policeman
does when he wants the automobiles to stop turning somersaults.</p>

<p>"Caw! Caw! Caw!" croaked the black crows high in the
white, snowy air. "Uncle Wiggily is calling us," said the head
crow. "Caw! Caw!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>Down they flew, perching on the bare limbs of trees in the
wood not far from the bunny's hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Crows!" greeted the rabbit. "I called you
because I want you to take a few Christmas presents to some
boys who, otherwise, will not get any. Their chimneys are
choked with black soot!"</p>

<p>"Black soot will not bother us," said the largest crow of all.
"We don't mind going down the blackest chimney in the
world!"</p>

<p>"I thought you wouldn't," said Uncle Wiggily. "That's
why I called you. Now, of course, I know that the kind of
presents that Santa Claus will bring to the animal children will
not all be such as real boys and girls would like. But still there
are some which may do."</p>

<p>"I can get willow whistles, made by Grandpa Lightfoot, the
old squirrel gentleman. I can get wooden puzzles gnawed
from the aspen tree by Grandpa Whackum, the beaver. Grandpa
Goosey Gander and I will gather the round, brown balls
from the sycamore tree, and the boys can use them for marbles."</p>

<p>"Those will be very nice presents, indeed," cawed a middle-sized
crow. "The boys ought to like them."</p>

<p>"And will you take the things down the black chimneys?"
asked Uncle Wiggily. "I'll give you some of Nurse Jane's
thread so you may easily carry the whistles, puzzles, wooden
marbles and other presents."</p>

<p>"We'll take them down the chimneys!" cawed the crows. "It
matters not to us how much black soot there is! It will not
show on our black wings."</p>

<p>So among his friends Uncle Wiggily gathered up bundles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of woodland presents. And in the dusk of Christmas eve the
black crows fluttered silently in from the forest, gathered up
in their claws the presents which the bunny had tied with
thread, and away they flapped, not only to the houses of the
two boys, but also to the homes of some girls, about whom Uncle
Wiggily had heard. Their chimneys, too, it seemed, were
choked with soot.</p>

<p>But the crows could be made no blacker, not even if you
dusted them with charcoal, so they did not in the least mind
fluttering down the sooty chimneys. And so softly did they
make their way, that not a boy or girl heard them! As silently
and as quietly as Santa Claus himself went the crows!</p>

<p>All during Christmas eve they fluttered down the chimneys
at the homes of poor boys and girls, helping St. Nicholas, until
all the presents that Uncle Wiggily had gathered from his
friends had been put in place.</p>

<p>Then, throughout Woodland, in the homes of Sammie and
Susie Littletail the rabbits, of Johnnie and Billie Bushytail the
squirrels, Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the dogs, Curly and
Floppy Twistytail the piggie boys&mdash;in all the homes of Woodland
great changes took place. Firefly lights began to glow on
Christmas trees. Mysterious bundles seemed to come from nowhere,
and took their places under the trees, in stockings and
on chairs or mantels.</p>

<p>And then night came, and all was still, and quiet and dark&mdash;as
dark as the black crows or the soot in the chimneys.</p>

<p>But in the morning, when the stars had faded, and the moon
was pale, the glorious sun came up and made the snow sparkle
like ten million billion diamonds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>"Merry Christmas, Uncle Wiggily!" called Nurse Jane.
"See what Santa Claus brought me."</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, Nurse Jane!" answered the bunny. "And
what a fine lot of presents St. Nicholas left for me! See them!"</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't he a great old chap!" laughed Nurse Jane, as she
smelled a bottle of perfume.</p>

<p>And all over the land voices could be heard saying:</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"</p>

<p>Near the hearth in the homes of some boys and girls who had
not gone to bed with happy thoughts of the morrow, were some
delightful presents. How they opened their eyes and stared&mdash;these
boys and girls who had expected no Christmas.</p>

<p>"Why! Why!" exclaimed one of the two lads whom Uncle
Wiggily had heard talking near the snowbank. "How in the
world did Santa Claus get down our black chimney?"</p>

<p>But, of course, they knew nothing of Uncle Wiggily and the
crows. And please don't you tell them.</p>

<p>So all over, in the Land of Boys and Girls, as well as in the
Snow Forest of the Animal Folk, there echoed the happy calls
of:</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" Once again there
was joy in the land.</p>

<p>And if the sunflower doesn't shine in the face of the clock,
and make its hands go whizzing around backward, I shall take
pleasure, next, in telling you about Uncle Wiggily's Fourth
of July.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII">STORY XII</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY'S FOURTH OF JULY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"You must be extra careful to-morrow, Uncle Wiggily," said
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy to the bunny rabbit gentleman one
morning, as he stood on the steps of his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>"Why be careful to-morrow, more than on any other day
in the year?" asked Mr. Longears. "Is it going to rain or
snow?"</p>

<p>"Whoever heard of snow on the Fourth of July?" inquired
the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she fastened a fluffy brush to
the end of her tail, for she was presently going in the house to
dust the furniture.</p>

<p>"Oh, so to-morrow is the Fourth of July!" exclaimed the
bunny. "I had forgotten all about it. Yes, indeed, I must be
careful! I am living near the real children, now, and some
of them might think it fun to explode a torpedo under my pink,
twinkling nose, or try to fasten a fire-cracker to my little tail."</p>

<p>"That's what I was thinking of," went on Nurse Jane. For
Uncle Wiggily's bungalow, while still in the woods, was near
to the homes of some boys and girls. And though only one boy,
so far, had been bad to the bunny (and this boy soon turned
good), there was no telling what might happen.</p>

<p>So as Uncle Wiggily hopped along the forest path, he took
care not to get too far away from the bushes, behind and under
which he could hide. For sometimes boys and girls came to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
forest, and once a Kite Boy was lost, and the bunny helped him
find his way home, you may remember.</p>

<p>"Hello, Uncle Wiggily!" suddenly called a voice, and Mr.
Longears quickly jumped around, thinking it might be a real
boy or girl. But it was only Neddie Stubtail, the little boy
bear.</p>

<p>"I've been buying my fire-crackers," said Neddie to his uncle,
the bunny. "I'm going to have lots of fun Fourth of July,"
and he showed Mr. Longears a bundle of dry sticks, painted
red, white and blue like the bunny's rheumatism crutch.</p>

<p>You must know that in Animal Land the boys and girls have
the same sort of fun you children do on holidays, but in a different
manner. Instead of real fire-crackers, that have to be
set off with a match, or piece of punk, with sparks that, perhaps,
burn you, the animal children get some dried sticks. These
they break, with loud, cracking sounds, but without any fire.
And they have lots of fun. After the sticks are broken they can
be put in the stove to boil the tea kettle.</p>

<p>"Did you get your sister, Beckie, any Fourth of July things?"
asked Uncle Wiggily of the boy bear.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I got her some little stick crackers," answered
Neddie.</p>

<p>"That's good!" spoke Mr. Longears. Then he went on
through the woods, meeting Toddle and Noodle Flat-Tail the
beaver boys, Joie, Tommie and Kittie Kat the kittens, Nannie
and Billie Wagtail the goats, and many other animal boys and
girls. All of them called:</p>

<p>"Hello, Uncle Wiggily! Happy Fourth of July!"</p>

<p>And the bunny answered back:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thank you! I wish you the same!"</p>

<p>Thus hopping through the woods, meeting the animal children,
and learning of the fun they were to have next day, the
bunny rabbit gentleman at length came to the end of the forest.
A little farther on were the houses and homes of real boys and
girls, some of whom had been helped by Mr. Longears.</p>

<p>"I think this is as far as I had better go, seeing it's so close
to the Fourth of July," thought Uncle Wiggily. "If the real
children are anything like those of my animal friends who live
in the woods, they'll be shooting off their crackers and torpedoes
ahead of time."</p>

<p>And, just as he said that, Uncle Wiggily heard a loud:</p>

<p>"Bang! Bang!"</p>

<p>The bunny jumped to one side, and hid under the broad leaf
of a burdock plant. Then he laughed.</p>

<p>"I thought that was a hunter-man's gun," whispered Uncle
Wiggily. "But I guess it was some boy setting off a fire-cracker.
I need not have been afraid."</p>

<p>He was just going to hop along a little farther, before turning
back to his hollow stump bungalow when, all at once he
saw a hammock swinging between two trees near the edge of
the wood.</p>

<p>In the hammock lay a boy with a thin, pale face, and beside
him sat a nurse, gently pulling on a rope that caused the little
nest-like swinging bed to sway to and fro.</p>

<p>"Oh ho!" thought Uncle Wiggily. "A sick boy! I'm sorry
for him! He won't be able to run around and have fun on
Fourth of July as Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow will."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>And then the bunny heard the boy in the hammock speaking.
And, being able, as he was of late, to understand the talk of
real persons, Uncle Wiggily heard the boy say:</p>

<p>"Do you think I'll ever be able to run around again, and have
fun, and shoot off fire-crackers?"</p>

<p>"Of course you will," the nurse answered cheerfully.</p>

<p>"But I can't have any fire-crackers now, can I?" asked the
boy, timidly, as though knowing what the answer would be.</p>

<p>"No, Buddie! You are not quite well enough," the nurse
gently replied. "No fire-crackers for you!"</p>

<p>"How about torpedoes?"</p>

<p>"You couldn't have those, either, I'm afraid," and the nurse
smiled as she leaned over to give the boy a drink of orange
juice.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed the boy in the hammock, just like that.
"Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily felt very sorry for him.</p>

<p>"I wish I could do something," thought the bunny gentleman.
"This boy won't have much fun on the Fourth of July&mdash;not
even as much fun as Curly and Floppy Twistytail, the
piggie chaps, will have throwing corncobs against a tin pan and
making believe they are skyrockets."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" again sighed the boy in the hammock. "Oh,
dear!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" asked his nurse.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose I could even have a Roman candle, or a pinwheel,
could I?" the invalid asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed no!" laughed the nurse. "What a funny chap
you are!"</p>

<p>But the boy didn't feel very funny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Uncle Wiggily twinkled his pink nose. Then he put his tall,
silk hat firmly on his head and, tucking under his paw his red,
white and blue striped rheumatism crutch, off through the
woods hopped the bunny uncle.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get some Fourth of July for that boy," said
Mr. Longears. "He simply must have some."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily spent some time hopping here and there
through the woods, and early the next morning, when the real
boys and girls were shooting off real fire-crackers and torpedoes,
and when the animal lads and lassies were cracking sticks and
making torpedoes from broad, green leaves, Mr. Longears
hopped to where the boy was, once more, swinging in his hammock.</p>

<p>The boy's head was turned to one side, and he was looking
at some of his friends, over in the vacant lots, setting off fire-crackers.
Uncle Wiggily, when the nurse wasn't looking, tossed
into the hammock, from the bush behind which the bunny was
hidden, a bundle of green things. They fell near the boy's
hands.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what he was doing the sick lad pinched one
of the green things between his fingers.</p>

<p>"Pop!" it went.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried the nurse. "It sounded like a fire-cracker."</p>

<p>The boy pinched another green leaf-like ball between his
fingers.</p>

<p>"Pop!" sounded again, as the ball burst.</p>

<p>"Why," cried the nurse. "That's like a torpedo! What have
you there, Buddie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't know," the boy answered. "But these round, green
balls, that burst and pop when I squeeze them, fell into my
hammock. There's a lot of 'em! I can pinch them and make
a noise for Fourth of July."</p>

<p>"So you can!" exclaimed the nurse, pinching one herself, and
jumping when it went "Pop!"</p>

<p>"And they won't hurt me, will they?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"No," answered the nurse, "they won't hurt you at all. They
must have fallen off this tree, but I never knew, before, that
such things as green fire-crackers grew on trees!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed Uncle Wiggily to himself, hidden under
a bush. "She doesn't know I brought the puff balls to
the boy."</p>

<p>For that is what the bunny had done. In the woods he had
found the green puff balls, inside which were the seeds of the
plant. Later on, in the fall, the puff balls would be dry, and
would crackle when you touched them, opening to scatter the
seeds. But now, being green, and filled with air, they burst
with a Fourth of July noise when squeezed.</p>

<p>"Oh, now I can have some fun!" laughed the sick boy, as he
cracked one puff ball after another. "Hurrah! Now I'm celebrating
Fourth of July!"</p>

<p>And he was. Uncle Wiggily had helped him, and the
bunny gentleman had brought enough puff balls to last all
day.</p>

<p>"Pop! Pop!" That is how they sounded as the boy pinched
them in his hammock. Some were large, like big fire-crackers,
and others were small, like little torpedoes.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lovely Fourth of July!" sighed the boy, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
evening came to put the sun to bed, and the nurse wheeled the
boy into the house.</p>

<p>And then, when it grew dark, Uncle Wiggily called together
ten thousand firefly-lightning bugs, and they flittered and
fluttered about the porch, on which the boy had been taken
after supper. The fireflies made pinwheels of themselves, they
went up like skyrockets, they leaped about in bunches like the
balls from Roman candles and finally, when it was time to go
to bed, they took hold of each others' legs and, clinging together,
spelled out:</p>

</div>

<p>"Oh, it's just like real fireworks!" cried the happy boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm glad he liked it!" said Uncle Wiggily, as he hopped
home to his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>So if the pussy cat doesn't claw the tail off the letter Q and
make it look like a big, round O, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the little boy's skates.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">STORY XIII</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SKATES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There was once a little boy to whom Santa Claus brought
a pair of skates at Christmas. And, of course, that boy, as soon
as he saw the shiny, steel runners, wished that the pond would
freeze over so that he might try his new playthings.</p>

<p>"When do you s'pose there'll be skating?" he asked his
mother again and again, for, as yet, there was only a "skim" of
ice on the pond.</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty soon," his mother would answer. "You mustn't
go skating when the ice is too thin, you know. If you did you
would break through, into the cold water."</p>

<p>"And that would spoil my skates, wouldn't it?" asked the
boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, but besides that you might be drowned, or catch cold
and be very ill," Mother said. "So keep off the ice with your
new skates until the pond has frozen good and thick."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, I will," promised the little boy, and, really, he meant
to keep his word. But as the days passed, and the weather was
not quite cold enough to freeze thick ice, the little boy became
tired of waiting.</p>

<p>Every chance he had, after school, he would go down to the
edge of the pond, and throw stones on the ice to see how thick
it was. Often the stones would break through, and fall into
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
cold, black water with a "thump!" Then the boy would
know the ice was not thick enough.</p>

<p>"I don't want to fall through like a stone," he would say,
and back to his house he would go with his new skates dangling
and jingling at his back, over which they were hung by a strap.</p>

<p>But one day, when the boy threw a large stone on the ice of
the pond, instead of breaking through, the rock only made a
dent and stayed there.</p>

<p>"Oh, hurray!" cried the boy. "I guess it's strong enough to
hold me now! I'm going skating!"</p>

<p>However, first he started to walk on the edge of the ice near
the shore, and when he did so, and heard cracking sounds, he
jumped quickly back.</p>

<p>"I guess I'd better not try it yet," said the boy to himself.
"I'll wait a little while until it freezes harder."</p>

<p>So he sat down by the edge of the pond to wait for the ice
to freeze harder. But as he sat there, and saw how white and
shiny it was, and as he looked at his new skates, which he had
only put on in the house, that boy couldn't wait another minute.</p>

<p>He walked along the shore a little farther, to a place where
the ice seemed more hard and shiny and there, after throwing
some stones, and venturing out a little way, finding that there
was no cracking sound, the little boy made up his mind to try
to skate. There was no one else on the pond&mdash;no other boys
and girls, and it was a bit lonesome. But the boy was so eager
to try his new skates that he did not think of this.</p>

<p>Down he sat on the ground, and began putting on his Christmas
skates. And it was just about this time that Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, Uncle Wiggily's muskrat lady housekeeper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
happened to look out of the window of the hollow stump bungalow.
The bunny's bungalow was so hidden in the woods,
near the pond, that few boys or girls ever saw the queer little
house. But Uncle Wiggily could see them, as they came to
the woods winter and summer, and often he was able to help
them.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" exclaimed Nurse Jane, as she looked out
of the window a second time.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Uncle Wiggily, who was just
finishing his breakfast of lettuce bread and carrot coffee, with
some turnip marmalade.</p>

<p>"Why, there's a boy&mdash;a real boy and not one of the animal
chaps&mdash;getting ready to go skating!" said the muskrat lady, for
she could see the boy putting on his skates.</p>

<p>"That ice isn't thick enough for real boys or girls to skate
on," the bunny gentleman said. "It would be all right for
Sammie Littletail, or Johnnie or Billie Bushytail, but real boys
are too heavy&mdash;much heavier than my nephew Sammie the rabbit,
or than the bushytail squirrel chaps."</p>

<p>"Well, this boy is going on all the same," cried Nurse Jane.
"And I know he'll break through, and he'll frighten his mother
into a conniption fit!"</p>

<p>"That will be too bad!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he
wiped a little of the turnip marmalade off his whiskers, where
it had fallen by mistake. "I must try to save him if he does
fall in!"</p>

<p>"It would be better to keep him from going on the ice," spoke
Nurse Jane. "Safety first, you know!"</p>

<p>"If I could speak boy language I'd hop down there and tell
him <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the ice is too thin," answered Uncle Wiggily. "But though
I know what the boys and girls say, I cannot, myself, speak
their talk. However, I think I know a way to save this boy, if
he happens to break through the ice."</p>

<p>"Well, he's almost sure to break through," declared Miss
Fuzzy Wuzzy, "so you'd better hurry."</p>

<p>"No sooner said than done!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, and,
catching up his red, white and blue striped rheumatism crutch,
and putting on his fur cap (for the day was cold), away the
bunny hopped from his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>Instead of going to the place where the boy, with his skates
fastened on his shoes, was about to try the ice, the bunny gentleman
went to the house of some friends of his. The house
would seem queer to you, for all it looked like was a pile of
sticks half buried in the frozen pond.</p>

<p>But in this house lived a family of beavers&mdash;queer animals
whose fur is so warm and thick that they can swim in ice water
and not feel chilly. In fact the beavers had to dive down under
the ice and water to get into their winter home.</p>

<p>"Are Toodle and Noodle in the house?" asked Uncle Wiggily,
as he reached the stick-house. On shore, not far from it,
was Grandpa Whackum, the old beaver gentleman, with his
broad, flat tail.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Toodle and Noodle are inside," answered Grandpa
Whackum. "Shall I call them out?"</p>

<p>"If you please," spoke Uncle Wiggily. "I want them to
come and help me save a boy who, I think, is going to break
through the thin ice with his new skates."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>"That will be too bad!" exclaimed Grandpa Whackum.
Then with his broad tail he pounded or "whacked" on the
ground, and soon up through a hole in the ice came swimming
Toodle and Noodle Flat-Tail, the two beaver boys.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/p089_650.jpg" width="650" height="443" alt="Oh hello Uncle Wiggily!" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, hello, Uncle Wiggily!" they called. "We're glad to
see you!"</p>

<p>"Hello!" answered the bunny gentleman. "Will you come
with me, and help save a real boy?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Toodle, shaking off some ice water from
his fur coat.</p>

<p>"He won't try to catch us, will he?" asked Noodle.</p>

<p>"I think not," the bunny gentleman replied. "If what I
think is going to happen, does really happen, that boy will be
too surprised to catch anything but a cold! Come along, beaver
chaps!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>So Toodle and Noodle, wet and glistening from having dived
out of their house, and down under water to come up through
the hole in the ice, followed Uncle Wiggily. The sun and wind
soon dried their fur.</p>

<p>"There's the boy," said Uncle Wiggily, as he and the beaver
chaps reached the edge of the pond. "He's skating on thin ice.
He'll go through in a minute!"</p>

<p>And, surely enough, hardly had the bunny spoken than there
was a cracking sound, the ice broke beneath the boy's feet and
into the dark, cold water he fell.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried the boy. "Help me, somebody! Oh!
Oh!"</p>

<p>"Ha! It's a good thing Nurse Jane saw him!" said Uncle
Wiggily. "Quick now, Toodle and Noodle! I brought you
along because you have such good, sharp teeth&mdash;much sharper
and better than mine are for gnawing down trees. I can gnaw
off the bark, but you can nibble all the way through a tree and
make it fall."</p>

<p>"Is that what you want us to do?" asked Toodle.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Uncle Wiggily. "We'll go close to shore,
where the boy has fallen in. Near him is a tree. You'll gnaw
that so it will fall outward across the ice, and he can reach up,
take hold of it and pull himself out of the hole."</p>

<p>By this time the poor boy was floundering around in the cold
water. He tried to get hold of the edges of the ice around the
hole through which he had fallen, but the ice broke in his hands.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" he cried.</p>

<p>"We're going to help you," answered Uncle Wiggily, but, of
course, he spoke animal language which the boy did not understand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
But Toodle and Noodle understood, and quickly running
to the edge of the shore they gnawed and gnawed and
gnawed very extra fast at an overhanging tree until it began
to bend and break. Uncle Wiggily gnawed a little, also, to
help the beaver boys.</p>

<p>Then, just as the real boy was almost ready to sink down
under water, the tree fell on the ice, some of its branches close
enough so the boy skater could grasp them.</p>

<p>"Oh, now I can pull myself out!" he said. "This tree fell
just in time! Now I'll be saved!"</p>

<p>He did not know that Uncle Wiggily and the beaver boys
had gnawed the tree down, making it fall just in the right place
at the right time. For the boy was so frightened at having
broken through the ice, that he never noticed the bunny gentleman
and the beaver boys on shore.</p>

<p>He caught hold of the tree branches in his cold fingers, pulled
himself up out of the water, that boy did; and to shore. Then
as he sat down, all wet and shivering, to take off his skates, so
he could run home, Uncle Wiggily called to Toodle and
Noodle:</p>

<p>"Come on, beaver boys! Our work is done! We have saved
that boy, and I hope he never again tries to skate on thin ice."</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily hopped toward his hollow stump bungalow,
and the beaver boys slid on the ice, near shore, toward
their own stick-house, for the pond was frozen hard and thick
enough to hold them. And the boy ran home as fast as he
could, and drank hot lemonade so he wouldn't catch cold.</p>

<p>He did get the snuffles, but of course that couldn't be helped,
and it wasn't much for falling through the ice; was it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>"You never should have gone skating until the pond was
better frozen," his mother said.</p>

<p>"I know it," the boy answered. "But wasn't it lucky that
tree fell when it did?"</p>

<p>"Very lucky!" agreed his mother. And neither the boy nor
his mother knew that it was Nurse Jane, Uncle Wiggily and
the beaver boys who had caused the tree to topple over just in
time.</p>

<p>But that's the way it sometimes is in this world. And if the
cow doesn't tickle the man in the moon with her horns, when
she jumps over the green cheese, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily going coasting.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">STORY XIV</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY GOES COASTING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Oh, it's stopped snowing! It's stopped snowing! Now
we can go coasting; can't we, Mother?"</p>

<p>"And on our new Christmas sleds! Oh, what fun!"</p>

<p>A boy and a girl ran from the window, against which they
had been pressing their noses, looking out to see when the white
flakes would stop falling from the sky. Now the storm seemed
to be over, leaving the ground covered with the sparkling snow
crystals.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may go coasting a little while," said Mother.
"But don't stay too late. When Daddy comes to supper you
must be home."</p>

<p>"We will!" promised the boy and girl, and, laughing in glee,
they ran to get on their boots, their mittens and warm coats.</p>

<p>"I want to go coasting! Take me to slide down hill!" cried
Bumps, the little sister of the boy and girl. "I want a sleigh
ride."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bumps, you're too little!" objected Sister.</p>

<p>"And she'll fall down and bang herself," added Brother. In
fact the "littlest girl" did fall down so often that she was called
"Bumps" as a pet name.</p>

<p>"I won't fall down!" Bumps promised. "I'll be good!
Please take me coasting?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>"I think you might take her," said Mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, we will," spoke Sister. "Come on, Bumps!"</p>

<p>"Well, if she falls off the sled when it's going down hill, and
she gets bumped, it won't be my fault!" declared Brother.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'll be good&mdash;I won't fall!" promised Bumps. So
Mother bundled her up, and out she went to the coasting hill
with Brother and Sister, each of whom had a sled.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to give her rides on my sled all the while!"
said Brother, half grumbling.</p>

<p>"We'll take turns," more kindly suggested Sister. "Take
hold of my hand, Bumps, and don't fall any more times than
you can help, dear!"</p>

<p>"No; I won't," answered Bumps. The littlest girl was smiling
and happy because she was going coasting with Sister and
Brother. And she made up her mind she would try very, very
hard not to fall.</p>

<p>On the other side of the forest, near which was the coasting
hill of the children, lived Uncle Wiggily in his hollow stump
bungalow. From afar he had often watched the boys and girls
sliding down on their sleds, but the bunny gentleman had never
gone very close.</p>

<p>"For," he said to himself, "they might, by accident, run over
me. And, though I haven't much of a tail to be cut off, I would
look queer if anything should happen to my long ears. I'll
keep away from the coasting hill of the boys and girls."</p>

<p>But not far from the bunny's bungalow was another and
smaller hill, down which the animal boys and girls coasted. Of
course, very few of them had such sleds as you children have,
with shiny steel runners, and with the tops painted red, blue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
green and gold. In fact, some of the animal boys didn't bother
with a sled at all.</p>

<p>Take Toodle and Noodle Flat-Tail, the beaver chaps, for
instance. They just slid down hill on their broad, flat tails.
And as for Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels, they sat
on their fuzzy tails and scooted down the hill of snow. Others
of the animal children sometimes used pieces of wood, an old
board or some sticks bound together with strands from a wild
grape vine.</p>

<p>And about the time that Sister, Brother and Bumps went
coasting, Sammie and Susie Littletail, the rabbits, passed the
hollow stump bungalow of Uncle Wiggily Longears. The
little bunnies were each pulling a sled made from pieces of
birch bark they had gnawed from trees.</p>

<p>"Let's ask Uncle Wiggily to go coasting with us," spoke
Susie.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Let's!" echoed Sammie. "It'll be lots of fun!"</p>

<p>And Uncle Wiggily was very glad to go coasting. Out of
his bungalow he hopped, his pink nose twinkling twice as fast
as the shiny star on top of the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Wiggy!" cried Nurse Jane. "You don't mean
to say you're going coasting with your rheumatism!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm going coasting with Sammie and Susie," the laughing
bunny answered. "I haven't any rheumatism to go coasting
with to-day, I'm glad to tell you." And, surely enough,
he didn't need to take his red, white and blue striped
crutch.</p>

<p>When Sammie, Susie and Uncle Wiggily reached the coasting
hill, they found there many of the animal children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
"Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Ride on my sled!" invited one after
another. "Ride on mine! Coast with me!"</p>

<p>"I'll take turns with each one!" promised the bunny gentleman,
and so he did, riding with Sammie and Susie first, then
with the Bushytail squirrel brothers, next with Lulu, Alice and
Jimmie Wibblewobble, the ducks, and so on down to Dottie
and Willie Flufftail, the lamb children.</p>

<p>Oh, such fun as Uncle Wiggily had on the animal children's
coasting hill. And on the other side of the forest, Sister,
Brother and Bumps had their fun, with the real boys and girls.</p>

<p>At last it began to grow dusk, and when Uncle Wiggily was
thinking of telling the animal children it was time for them to
leave for home, up came rushing Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow,
the puppy dog boys.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" barked Jackie. "We were just over
to the big hill, where the real boys coast, and we saw&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We saw a little baby girl&mdash;that is, almost a baby&mdash;in a pile
of snow!" finished Peetie, for his brother Jackie was out of
breath and couldn't bark any more.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Uncle Wiggily. "A real, live little
girl in the snow?"</p>

<p>"Right in a snow drift!" barked Jackie. "All alone!"</p>

<p>"Why," said the bunny gentleman, as he thought it over,
"she must have been coasting with her brother or sister, and
maybe she fell off a sled and went down deep in the snow. And
they played so hard they never missed her! But she mustn't be
allowed to stay asleep in the snow. She'll freeze!"</p>

<p>"If she's only a little one&mdash;almost a baby&mdash;couldn't we put
her on one of our sleds?" asked Sammie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"And ride her home," went on Susie.</p>

<p>"If we all pull together we'd be strong enough to pull a real,
live girl, if she wasn't too large," quacked Jimmie Wibblewobble,
the duck.</p>

<p>"We'll try!" said Uncle Wiggily. "All of you take the grape-vine
ropes from your sleds and follow me."</p>

<p>Quickly the animal children did this, taking with them only
the large double sled of Neddie Stubtail, the boy bear, which
was the largest sled of all. It was low and flat, and Uncle
Wiggily thought it would be easy to roll a little girl up on it
and pull her along.</p>

<p>Soon Uncle Wiggily and the animal children reached the
hill where the real boys and girls had coasted. None of them
was there now, all having gone home to their suppers.</p>

<p>"Here she is!" softly barked Jackie, leading the way to a
snowbank, at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>And there, sound asleep in the soft, warm snow was&mdash;Bumps!</p>

<p>Yes, as true as I'm telling you&mdash;Bumps!</p>

<p>The little girl had been sliding down with her sister, and
had rolled off the sled at the bottom of the hill after about the
forty-'leventh coast. And Bumps was so tired, and sleepy, from
having been outdoors so long, that, as soon as she rolled from
the sled into the snow, she fell asleep! Think of that!</p>

<p>And as Sister wanted to have a race with Brother and some
of the other children, she never noticed what happened to
Bumps. But there she was&mdash;in the snow asleep. Poor little
Bumps!</p>

<p>"It will never do to leave her here!" whispered Uncle Wiggily
to the animal boys and girls. "Don't awaken her, but roll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
her over on Neddie's sled, and we'll pull her to her home. I
know where she lives. We'll leave her in front of the door,
I'll throw a snowball to make a sound like a knock, and then
we can run away. Her father and mother will come out and
take her in."</p>

<p>So all working together, pushing, pulling, tugging and rolling
most gently, the bunny gentleman and the animal boys and
girls slid Bumps upon the low sled of the bear boy. Then they
fastened the grape-vine ropes to it, and, all taking hold, off they
started over the snow toward the village.</p>

<p>It was almost dark, so no one saw the strange procession of
Uncle Wiggily and his friends; and the bunny gentleman was
glad of this. Right up to the home of Bumps they pulled her,
and just as they got the sled in her yard Bumps opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" she cried when she saw all the animal
children, and Uncle Wiggily, too, standing around her. "I'm
in fairyland! Oh, how I love it!"</p>

<p>"Quick, Sammie&mdash;Susie&mdash;Jackie&mdash;Peetie&mdash;scoot away!"
called Uncle Wiggily in animal talk, and the rabbits, squirrels,
guinea pigs, ducks, bears, beavers and others, all hopped away
through the soft snow, out of sight. Uncle Wiggily tossed a
snowball at the door, making a sound like a knock, and then the
bunny gentleman also hopped away, laughing to himself.</p>

<p>He turned back in time to see the door open and Sister,
Brother, Daddy and Mother rush out.</p>

<p>"Oh, here's Bumps, now!" cried Brother. "We must have
forgotten and left her at the hill."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's what we did!" exclaimed Sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
"Yes, but how did she get home?" asked Mother. "She
never walked, I'm sure!"</p>

<p>"And look at the queer wooden sled!" said Sister.</p>

<p>"Who brought you home, Bumps?" asked Daddy.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a nice bunny man, and some little bunnies, and squirrels,
and a little bear boy and some ducks and chickens and little
lambs and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" But Bumps was out of breath now.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's been asleep and <i>dreamed</i> this!" laughed Brother.
"Some man must have found her and put her on this board for
a sled, to bring her home."</p>

<p>"Nope!" declared Bumps, "it was a bunny! It was a funny
bunny!"</p>

<p>"Bring her in the house!" laughed Mother. "She must have
been dreaming!"</p>

<p>But we know it wasn't a dream; don't we? And if the
strawberry shortcake doesn't go swimming with the gold fish
in the lemonade and catch cold, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the picnic.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY'S PICNIC</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Come on, Uncle Wiggily! Wake up! Wake up!" called
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy in the hollow stump bungalow one
morning. "Come on!"</p>

<p>"What's that? What's the matter? Is the chimney on fire
again?" asked the bunny gentleman, and he was so excited that
he slid down the banister, instead of hopping along from step
to step as he should have done.</p>

<p>"Of course the chimney isn't on fire!" laughed Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy. "But this is the day for the picnic of the animal children,
and you promised to go with them to the woods."</p>

<p>"Oh, so I did!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, and he put one
paw on his pink nose to stop the twinkling, which started as
soon as he grew excited over thinking the chimney was on fire.
"Well, I'm glad you called me, Nurse Jane. I'll get ready
for the picnic at once. What are you going to put up for
lunch?"</p>

<p>"Oh, some carrot bread, turnip cookies, lettuce sandwiches
and nut cake," answered the muskrat lady.</p>

<p>"That sounds fine!" laughed Uncle Wiggily. "I'm very glad
I'm going to the picnic!"</p>

<p>"Well, you had better hurry and get ready," remarked Miss
Fuzzy Wuzzy. "Here come Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow to see
if you aren't soon going to start."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Uncle Wiggily looked from the window of his hollow stump
bungalow, and saw the two little puppy dog boys coming
along.</p>

<p>Jackie was so excited that he stubbed his paw and fell down
twice, while Peetie was so anxious to show Uncle Wiggily
what was in the package of lunch the puppies were going to
take to the woods, that Peetie fell down three times, and turned
a back somersault.</p>

<p>"Uncle Wiggily! Uncle Wiggily! Aren't you coming?"
barked Jackie.</p>

<p>"Hurry or it may rain and spoil the picnic," added Peetie.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not!" answered the bunny gentleman. "For if
there is one thing, more than another, that spoils a picnic, it is
rain! Snow isn't so bad, for we don't have picnics when it
snows."</p>

<p>"Maybe it won't rain," hopefully spoke Nurse Jane, who
was busy putting up lunch for Uncle Wiggily. "There isn't
a cloud in the sky!"</p>

<p>And, surely enough, when Uncle Wiggily, Nurse Jane and
dozens of animal children started off to the woods for their
picnic, the sun shone bravely down from the blue sky and a
more lovely day could not have been wished for.</p>

<p>The forest where the bunny gentleman, Nurse Jane and the
animal children went for their picnic was a large one, with
many trees and bushes. There were dozens of places for the
squirrels, rabbits, goats, ducks, dogs, pussy cats and others to
play; and when they reached the grove they put their lunches
under bushes, on the soft cool, green moss and began to have
fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Please turn skipping rope for us?"
begged Brighteyes, the little guinea pig girl.</p>

<p>"And please come play ball with us!" grunted Curly and
Floppy Twistytail, the piggie boys.</p>

<p>"Have a game of marbles with us," teased Billie Wagtail,
the goat, and Jacko Kinkytail, the monkey chap.</p>

<p>"I'll play with you all in turn," laughed the bunny gentleman.
He was in the midst of having fun, and was just gnawing
off a piece of wild grape vine to make a swing for Lulu and
Alice Wibblewobble, the ducks, when up came hopping Bully
No-Tail, the frog boy. Bully was quite excited.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bully?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Oh, gur-ump!" croaked Bully. "There is a big crowd of
boys and girls over on the other side of the pond. They're
having a picnic, too! Ger-ump! Ger-ump!"</p>

<p>"Real boys and girls!" added Bawly, who was Bully's
brother. "Hump-bump!"</p>

<p>"Well, that will do no harm!" laughed Uncle Wiggily.
"Let the real boys and girls have their picnic. They will not
see us, for very few boys and girls know how to use their eyes
when they go to the woods. I have often hidden beside a bush
close to where a boy passed, and he never saw me. Let the boys
and girls have their picnic, and we'll have ours!"</p>

<p>So that's the way it was. Uncle Wiggily and the animal
children played tag, and they slid down hill. Perhaps you
think they could not do this in summer when there was no snow.
But the hills in the forest were covered with long, smooth,
brown pine needles, and these layers of needles were so slippery
that it was easy to slide on them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
And then, all of a sudden, just about when it was time to
eat lunch, it began to rain! Oh, how hard the drops pelted
down! Rain! Rain! Rain!</p>

<p>"Scurry for shelter&mdash;all of you!" cried Nurse Jane. "Get
out of the rain!"</p>

<p>The animal boys and girls knew how to take care of themselves
in a rain storm, even if they had no umbrellas. Most of
them had on fur or feathers which water does not harm. And
they snuggled down under trees and bushes, finding shelter and
dry spots so that, no matter how hard it poured, they did not
get very wet.</p>

<p>They hid their lunches under rocks and overhanging trees
so nothing was spoiled. And when the rain was over and the
sun came out, as it did, the animal picnic went on as before,
and when the food was set out on flat stumps for tables, there
was enough for everyone, and plenty left over.</p>

<p>Nurse Jane was looking at what remained of the good things
to eat when Jackie Bow Wow, who, with Peetie, had been
splashing in a mud puddle, came running up wagging his tail.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" barked Jackie. "What you think?
Those real children, on the other side of the wood, they had
their things to eat out on some stumps for tables, just as we
had, and when the rain came, oh! it spoiled everything!"</p>

<p>"They didn't know how to keep their lunches dry," added
Peetie. "Now they haven't anything to eat for their picnic,
and they are starting home, and some of the little girls are
crying."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
"That's too bad!" murmured Uncle Wiggily, kindly. "Too
bad that the rain had to spoil their picnic! Now we have plenty
of things left that children could eat&mdash;nuts, apples, some popcorn
and pears," for the animal folk had brought all these, and
many more, to the woods with them. "We have lots left over."</p>

<p>"We could give them something to eat," spoke Nurse Jane,
"but how are we going to get it to them? We can't call them
here; and it would never do to let them see us carrying the
things to them."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Uncle Wiggily. "But I think I have a plan.
We can make some baskets of birch bark. Some of the animal
children&mdash;such as Jacko and Jumpo Kinkytail, the monkeys,
Joie and Tommie Kat, Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels&mdash;are
good tree climbers. Let them climb trees near where
the real children are having their picnic, and lower to them,
on grape-vine ropes, the food we have left."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" mewed Tommie, the kitten boy. "What jolly
fun!"</p>

<p>Quickly Nurse Jane began to gather up the food. Uncle
Wiggily put it in birch bark baskets the animal children made
and then, with the baskets, fastened to vines, in their paws or
claws, the animal boys went through the wood to the place of
the other picnic. Uncle Wiggily and the remaining animal
children followed.</p>

<p>There the poor, disappointed real children were, looking at
their rain-soaked and spoiled lunches. Some of the little girls
were crying.</p>

<p>"We might as well go home," grumbled a boy. "Our picnic
is no good!"</p>

<p>"Mean old rain!" sighed a girl.</p>

<p>But just then the animal chaps with lunch from Uncle Wiggily's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
picnic&mdash;lunch which had not been rained on&mdash;climbed up
into trees over the heads of the boys and girls. Not a sound
did the animal chaps make. And when the real boys and girls
had their backs turned, there were lowered to the stump tables
enough good things for a jolly feast&mdash;apples, pears, popcorn,
nuts and many other dainties.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 625px;">
<img src="images/p105_625.jpg" width="625" height="453" alt="The animal boys scurried off" />
</div>

<p>A little girl happened to turn around and see the birch bark
baskets of good things just as the animal boys scurried off
through the trees.</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" cried the girl. "The fairies have been here!
They have left us some lunch in place of ours that the rain
spoiled. Oh, see the fairy lunch!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
And I suppose that is as good a name for it as any, since the
boys and girls didn't see Uncle Wiggily's friends lower the
baskets from the trees. And the real boys and girls ate the
lunch and had a most jolly time, and so did the bunny gentleman
and his picnic crowd.</p>

<p>Now if the rubber plant doesn't stretch over and tickle the
teapot so that it pours coffee instead of milk into the sugar
bowl, you may next hear about Uncle Wiggily in the rain
storm.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI">STORY XVI</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY'S RAIN STORM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Down pelted the rain in Animal Land.</p>

<p>It also poured in Boy and Girl Land, which was on the other
side of the forest from where Uncle Wiggily Longears lived in
his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>The bunny rabbit gentleman looked out of a window, and
saw the drops fall drip, drip, dripping from trees and bushes,
making little puddles amid the leaves where birds could come,
later, and take a bath.</p>

<p>"You aren't thinking of going out in this storm; are you?"
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady bungalow-keeper,
as she saw Mr. Longears putting on his coat.</p>

<p>"Why, I was, yes," slowly answered the bunny gentleman.
"I am neither sugar nor salt, that I will melt in the rain. And,
as it isn't freezing, I think I'll take a hop through the woods,
and see Grandfather Goosey Gander."</p>

<p>"Well, as long as you are going out, I wish you'd go to the
store for me," requested Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"Oh, bring a muskmelon for dinner," said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"A watermelon would be much easier to carry through the
rain," Uncle Wiggily answered. "I think I'll bring a watermelon.
If it gets wet no harm is done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
"All right," agreed Nurse Jane, laughing, so away hopped
the bunny rabbit uncle, over the fields and through the woods.
It seemed to rain harder and harder, but Uncle Wiggily did
not mind. He had an umbrella, though he did not always carry
one. It was made from a toadstool, and it kept off most of the
rain. Though, as Mr. Longears said, he was neither a lollypop
nor an ice-cream cone that would melt in a shower.</p>

<p>But not everyone was as happy as Uncle Wiggily in this
storm. On the other side of the forest, as I told you, was Boy
and Girl Land, and in one of the houses lived a brother and a
sister. They, too, stood at the window, pressing their noses
against the glass as the rain beat down, and they were not
happy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Rain, rain, go away!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come again some other day!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Brother and I want to go and play!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is the verse the little girl recited over and over again
as she watched the rain pelting down. But the storm did not
stop for all that she said the verse backward and frontward.</p>

<p>"Will it ever stop?" crossly cried the boy. "Why doesn't it
stop?" and he drummed on the window sill, banged his feet on
the floor and whistled. And his sister loudly recited over and
over again:</p>

<p class="center">"Rain, rain, go away!"</p>

<p>"Children! Children!" gently called Mother from where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
she was lying down in the next room. "Can't you please be a
little quiet? My head aches and I am trying to rest. The
noise makes my pain worse."</p>

<p>"We're sorry, Mother," said the girl.</p>

<p>"But being quiet isn't any fun!" grumbled the boy. "Why
can't we go out and play?"</p>

<p>"Because you would get all wet," answered his mother.
"I've told you that two or three times, dear. Now please be
quiet. It will stop raining sometime, and then you may go
out."</p>

<p>"What can we play with?" asked the boy, not very politely
I'm sorry to say.</p>

<p>"Why, some of your toys," replied his mother. "Surely you
have enough."</p>

<p>"I'm tired of 'em!" grunted the boy.</p>

<p>"So'm I," echoed his sister.</p>

<p>Then she began once more to say the verse about the rain,
as if that would do any good, and the boy rubbed his nose up
and down the window, making queer marks.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily, on his way to see Grandpa Goosey Gander,
and get a watermelon for Nurse Jane, took a short cut through
a field, and passed the house where the children were kept in
on account of the rain. And, as it happened, the window near
which the boy and girl stood was open a little way at the top.</p>

<p>So, as the bunny gentleman hopped past, he not only saw
the children, but he heard what they said, being able, as I have
before related to you, to understand real talk.</p>

<p>But the children were looking up at the sky so intently, trying
to see if it would stop raining, that they never noticed Uncle
Wiggily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Though if they had seen him, all dressed as he was
like a gentleman from the moving pictures, they would have
been very much surprised.</p>

<p>"Too bad those children have to stay in on account of the
rain," thought Uncle Wiggily. "I wonder if I couldn't find
some way of amusing them? If they are tired of their own
playthings I might toss in, through the open window, some of
the things the animal boys and girls play with. I'll do it!"</p>

<p>Off through the woods in the rain hopped Uncle Wiggily.
He found a number of smooth, brown acorns, some of which
had the cups, or caps still on. He filled one pocket with the
acorns.</p>

<p>Next the bunny picked up some cones from the pine tree.
There were large and small cones, and Nurse Jane always used
one as a nutmeg grater, it was so rough, while Uncle Wiggily
kept one near his bed to scratch his back at night.</p>

<p>"Let me see, what else would the animal children take?" said
the bunny to himself. "I think they would take some green
moss, and the girls would make beds with it for their dolls.
The animal boys would take hollow reeds and blow little pebbles
through them as real boys blow beans in their tin shooters.
I'll take some moss and reeds."</p>

<p>This the bunny uncle did, also picking up some empty snail
and periwinkle shells he found on the bank of a brook.</p>

<p>"The little girl can string these shells for beads," thought
the bunny. "And I'll strip off some pieces of white birch bark
so the boy can make a little canoe, as the Indians used to do."</p>

<p>Having gathered all these things&mdash;playthings which the animal
children found in the woods every day&mdash;the bunny hopped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
back to the house of the boy and girl. The window was open,
but the boy and girl had left it. The girl was giving her mother
a drink of water, and the boy was bringing up some coal for
the fire.</p>

<p>"This is my chance!" thought Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>Standing outside, he tossed in through the open window the
acorns, the pine cones, the shells, the moss and other things.
Then he hopped quickly away and hid behind a bush. He could
hear the children come back into the room, and soon he heard
the girl cry:</p>

<p>"Oh, look what the wind blew in! Some acorns! I can make
little cups of them, and use the tops for saucers! And I'll set a
play-party table for my doll, and decorate it with green moss.
Oh, how perfectly lovely!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to make a boat out of this birch bark!" cried the
boy. "And look! A hollow reed, like a bean blower! Now I
can have some fun!"</p>

<p>"Look at the lovely shells I can string and make a necklace
of!" went on the girl.</p>

<p>"And I can make wooden legs, and a wooden head and stick
em on these pine cones and make believe they're Noah's ark
animals!" laughed the boy. "Hurray!" he cried most happily.</p>

<p>"What is going on out there?" called Mother from where she
was lying down. "Have you found something to play with?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," answered the boy. "We'll be quiet now."</p>

<p>"And we don't care if it does rain," said the girl. "The wind
blew a lot of lovely things in the window!"</p>

<p>But of course we know that Uncle Wiggily tossed them in.</p>

<p>"I guess they'll be all right now, no matter how much it
rains,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
said the bunny, as he hopped along to see Grandpa
Goosey, and buy the snowmelon&mdash;excuse me, I mean the watermelon&mdash;for
Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>So this teaches us that sometimes a rain storm is good for letting
you find out new ways of having fun. And if the looking-glass
doesn't make funny faces at the rag doll, when she's trying
to see if her hair ribbon is on backward, on the next page you
may read about Uncle Wiggily and the mumps.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MUMPS</span></h2>

<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit gentleman, was
hopping through the woods one day, and he was thinking of
making his way over to the other side of the forest, where the
real boys and girls lived, hoping he might have an adventure,
when, all at once, Mr. Longears heard some voices talking behind
a mulberry bush.</p>

<p>"I know what we can do," said the voice of a boy, as Uncle
Wiggily could tell, for he had learned to know the talk of boys
and girls.</p>

<p>"What can we do?" asked the voice of another boy.</p>

<p>"We can pick up a lot of stones," went on the first boy, "and
we can make believe we're hunters, and we can walk through
the woods and throw stones at the birds, and squirrels, and
rabbits! Come on! Let's do it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I don't want to do <i>that</i>," said the second boy. "It
isn't any fun to throw stones at birds and bunnies. If you hit a
mother bird, and break her wing, she can't take anything to eat
to the little birds, and they'll starve."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
"Pooh! That's nothing!" exclaimed the first boy, and Uncle
Wiggily peeked over the top of the bush to see what manner of
boys these were. But the bunny rabbit gentleman kept himself
well hidden.</p>

<p>"I don't want any stones thrown at me," he thought.</p>

<p>"And," went on the second boy, who seemed rather kind, "if
you throw a stone at a rabbit you might break its leg, and then
it couldn't hop home to the baby rabbits."</p>

<p>"That is very true!" thought Uncle Wiggily, who was listening
to all that went on. "I wish there were more boys like this
kind one."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care!" grumbled the first boy. "I'm going off
and throw stones at birds and rabbits and squirrels!"</p>

<p>"And I'm going home," said the second boy. "I don't feel
very good. I have a pain in my cheek and maybe I'm going to
have the toothache."</p>

<p>"Goodness me, sakes alive! I hope nothing like <i>that</i> happens
to such a kind boy," thought Uncle Wiggily. "And as for that
other chap, I'll run ahead of him, through the woods, and tell
my friends to hide so he can't throw stones at them."</p>

<p>So, while one boy went home and the other picked up some
stones, Uncle Wiggily skipped along through the woods, calling,
in his animal talk, to his friends to hide themselves.</p>

<p>"For a boy is coming to stone you!" exclaimed the bunny rabbit
gentleman. "Hide! Hide away from the stone-throwing
boy!"</p>

<p>And so it happened that when the unkind chap came tramping
through the woods, the only bird he saw to stone was an old
black crow, as black as black could be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
"I'll hit you!" cried the boy, as he threw a stone.</p>

<p>But the crow was a wise old bird, and wastn't even afraid of
the scary, stuffed men that farmers put in their cornfields. So
the crow dodged the stone and then he laughed at the boy.</p>

<p>"Haw! Haw! Haw!" laughed the old black crow. "Haw!
Haw! Haw!"</p>

<p>The boy grew very cross at this, and threw more stones, and
some fell among the flower bushes where some bees were gathering
the sweet juices of flowers to make into honey. One stone
knocked a bee off a blossom, and spilled the honey it was gathering.</p>

<p>"Just for that I'm going to sting that boy!" buzzed the bee.
Out it flittered, making such a zipping sound around that boy's
head as to cause the bad chap to drop his stones and run away.
So the bee did not have to sting him after all.</p>

<p>"Boys are no good!" buzzed the bee to Uncle Wiggily, as the
honey chap flew back to the flowers.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>some</i> boys are good," said the bunny gentleman. "The
boy who was with this bad chap was good, and kind to animals.
And that reminds me; this boy said he didn't feel very well. I
must hop over to-morrow, and take a look at his house. I know
where he lives. I hope he isn't going to have the toothache."</p>

<p>But the kind boy, as I call him just for fun, you know, had
something worse than the toothache. His neck and jaws began
to swell in the night, and he could hardly swallow a drink of
water which his mother gave him when she heard him tossing in
bed.</p>

<p>"What you s'pose is the matter of me, Mother?" asked the boy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Mother, as she smoothed his pillow, "perhaps
you caught cold in the woods to-day."</p>

<p>But it was worse than that. When the Doctor came in the
morning, and looked at the boy, and gently felt of his neck
(even which gentle touch made the boy want to cry) the Doctor
said:</p>

<p>"Hum! Mumps!"</p>

<p>"Did you say 'bumps,' Doctor?" asked the boy's mother.
"Did he fall down and bump himself?"</p>

<p>"No, I said <i>mumps</i>!" exclaimed the doctor. "That's a swelling
inside his neck, and it will hurt him a lot. But if you keep
him in bed, and warm, and give him easy things to eat, he'll
soon be all right again."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" murmured Mother. "Well, I suppose <i>mumps</i>
are better than <i>bumps</i>!"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that," spoke the Doctor as he walked
to the door with the boy's mother. "Whatever you do," he said
in a whisper, "don't give him anything <i>sour</i>&mdash;such as lemons or
pickles. Sour things make the mumps pain more than ever.
Don't even <i>speak</i> of vinegar in front of him, or so much as <i>whisper</i>
it!"</p>

<p>"I won't," promised Mother.</p>

<p>But the boy's little sister overheard what Doctor and Mother
were saying, and, being a mischievous sort of girl, she decided
to have some fun. At least <i>she</i> called it fun.</p>

<p>"I'm going to stand in front of Brother and hold up a pickle
so he can see it," said Sister to herself. "I want to see what
he'll do!"</p>

<p>So Sister hurried down to the kitchen and brought up a pickle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Then she went in the room where Brother was in bed and, holding
the sour pickle in front of him, called:</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>And, no sooner did the boy look than he felt a sharp pain in
his throat, almost as bad as toothache, and he cried:</p>

<p>"Go on away! Stop showing me that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;" Well, he
couldn't even say the word "pickle," for just the thought of
anything sour hurts your mumps, you know.</p>

<p>The boy hid his face in his pillow, and when he couldn't see
the pickle he felt a little better. But his Sister was still full of
mischief.</p>

<p>"Lemons! Lemons! Nice sour lemons!" she called teasingly.</p>

<p>"Stop it! Stop it!" begged the boy. "Oh, how my mumps
hurt! Mother, make Sister stop hurting my mumps!"</p>

<p>And when Mother came, and found what Sister was doing,
she made the little girl go to bed, even though it was daytime.</p>

<p>"You will, very likely, get the mumps yourself," said Mother.
"And I hope no one says anything sour to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>And, later on, Sister did get the mumps, but I'm glad to say
her brother did not hold a lemon up in front of her. For, as I
told you, even the <i>thought</i> of anything sour hurts the mumps.</p>

<p>Now you know the reason why I didn't want you to read this
story when you had the swelling in your neck. It was better
to wait until your mumps were gone; wasn't it?</p>

<p>So this boy had the mumps, and he had them on both sides at
once, which is the very worst form. He could hardly swallow
anything because of the pain, even things that were not sour.
Now and then he managed to sip a little hot chocolate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
His mother put a warm flannel bandage around his face,
which was much swelled, and, thus wrapped up, the little boy
could, now and then, get out of bed.</p>

<p>It was on one of these times, when his jaws were wrapped up,
and his face swollen, that Uncle Wiggily happened to hop
along through the woods, not far from the Mump Boy's house.
And, having very good eyes, Mr. Longears saw the sick lad.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" thought the bunny gentleman. "He is ill,
just as he thought he was going to be! Toothache it is, too!"</p>

<p>"Who has the toothache!" asked Dr. Possum, for the animal
doctor came along just then, with his bag of medicine held fast
in the curl of his tail.</p>

<p>"That boy," answered Uncle Wiggily, pointing from the
bush, where he and Dr. Possum were hiding, to the window of
the boy's home.</p>

<p>"He hasn't the toothache! Those are the mumps!" said Dr.
Possum, who knew all about such things.</p>

<p>"Mumps!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "Oh, that's too bad.
Why, if that boy is mumpy he must have trouble eating. I wonder
if I could leave on his doorstep something he would like&mdash;something
that he wouldn't have to chew and which would
slip down easily?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you leave for him, don't have it <i>sour</i>," advised
Dr. Possum, as he hurried along to see Curly Twistytail, the
piggie boy, who had cut his nose on a piece of glass while digging
for wild sunflower roots in the woods.</p>

<p>"Ha! Nothing sour for the Mump Boy!" said Uncle Wiggily
to himself, as Dr. Possum hopped away. "Then something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
sweet will be just the proper thing. Sweet honey! I have it!
I'll ask my friends, the bees, for some of their honey. I'll get
Nurse Jane to make a little pail of birch bark, and I'll leave the
wild honey on the boy's stoop."</p>

<p>Off hopped the bunny gentleman, until he found where the
bees had their home in a hollow tree.</p>

<p>"Could you give me some honey for a good boy with bad
mumps?" asked the rabbit.</p>

<p>"Some honey for a good boy with the bad mumps?" said the
Queen Bee. "Certainly, Uncle Wiggily! As much as you
like!"</p>

<p>Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the bunny's muskrat lady housekeeper,
made a little box of white bark from the birch tree, and
when this pretty box was filled with wild, sweet honey, Uncle
Wiggily took it with him one evening.</p>

<p>It was time for the Mump Boy to go to bed, but the pain in
his neck was so bad that he cried.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry, too," he said. "Oh, why can't I eat something
that won't hurt my mumps?"</p>

<p>"I'll try to think of something for you," said Mother wearily.</p>

<p>Just then Uncle Wiggily hopped to the edge of the forest,
close to the Mump Boy's house, and running up, he put the birch
box of wild honey on the stoop. Then the bunny threw some
little stones at the door and hopped away, hiding in the bushes.</p>

<p>"Wait until I see who's at the door," said Mother, as she
smoothed the boy's pillow. "Then I'll get you something."</p>

<p>She looked out on the porch, and saw the little birch bark
box.</p>

<p>"It looks like a valentine," she thought, "though this isn't
Valentine's Day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
"What is it?" asked the boy. "Is it anything I can eat that
won't hurt my mumps?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, it is!" joyfully said his mother, as she saw what
it was. "Sweet, wild honey!"</p>

<p>Even the name, so different from sour pickles or lemons, made
the Mumps Boy feel better.</p>

<p>"Please give me some," he begged. "It sounds good!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 625px;">
<img src="images/p120_625.jpg" width="625" height="438" alt="Uncle Wiggily saw him at the window" />
</div>

<p>The wild sweet honey slipped down as gently as a feather,
not hurting the boy's neck at all. And soon after that he went
to sleep and in a few days he was better.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily saw the boy at the window, the bandage no
longer on his face, and he even saw the boy eating the last of
the wild honey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
"I guess he liked it," thought the bunny, as he hopped away.</p>

<p>When the boy was all better, and could be out and play, he
asked all of his friends which one it was who had left the honey
on the porch. One and all answered:</p>

<p>"I didn't do it!"</p>

<p>"I wonder who it was?" said the boy, over and over again.</p>

<p>Well, we know; don't we? But we aren't allowed to tell.
And when the Boy's Sister caught the mumps, Uncle Wiggily
left her some honey also. Which was very kind of him, I
think.</p>

<p>So if the little pussy cat doesn't drop her penny in the snowbank,
thinking it will turn into a dollar so she can buy a box
of lollypops, you may next hear about Uncle Wiggily and the
measles.</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII">STORY XVIII</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MEASLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a boy who didn't like to go to
school. Every chance he had he stayed at home instead of going
to his classes to learn his lessons.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would get up in the morning and say:</p>

<p>"Mother, I think I'm going to have the toothache. I guess I
better not go to school to-day."</p>

<p>But his mother would laugh and say:</p>

<p>"Oh, run along! If you get the toothache in school the
teacher will let you come home."</p>

<p>Then the boy would go to school, though he didn't want to,
and he would be thinking up some new excuse for staying home,
so really he did not recite his lessons as well as he might.</p>

<p>One day this boy came running in the house, all excited, and
called out:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother! I just know I can't go to school to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Mother.</p>

<p>"'Cause I've been playing with the boy across the street, an'
he's got the measles, an' I'll catch 'em an' I can't go to school.
You ought t' see! He's all covered with red spots!" The boy
who didn't like school was much excited. "He's all red spots!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Is he?" asked Mother. "Well, the measles aren't painful,
though they are 'catching,' as you children say. However, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
can't catch them quite as soon as one day. So you may go to
school until you break out with red spots. Then it will be time
enough to stay at home."</p>

<p>"Can't I stay home to-morrow?" begged the boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not!" laughed Mother. "I want you to go
to school and become a smart man! Time enough to stay home
when you get the measles!"</p>

<p>Now, of course, this did not suit that boy at all. When he
went to bed he was thinking and thinking of some plan
by which he could stay home from school. For there was to be
a hard lesson next day, and, though I am sorry to say it, that
boy was too lazy to study as he ought.</p>

<p>"If I could only break out with the measles I could stay
home," he kept saying over and over again as he lay in bed.
Every now and then he would get up, turn on the electric light
in his room and look at himself in the glass to see if any red
spots were coming. But he could see none.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Boysie?" his mother called to him from
her room. "Why are you so restless?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm getting the measles," he hopefully answered.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Go to sleep!" laughed Daddy.</p>

<p>Finally the boy did go to sleep, but either he dreamed it, or
the idea came to him in the night, for, early in the morning, he
awakened and, slipping on his bath robe, went into his sister's
room.</p>

<p>"Hey, Sis!" he whispered. "Where's your box of paints?"</p>

<p>"What you want 'em for?" asked Sister.</p>

<p>"Oh, I&mdash;I'm going to paint something," mumbled the boy.
Sister was too sleepy&mdash;for it was only early morning as yet&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
wonder much about it, so she told her brother where to find the
paints, and then she turned over and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Now what do you suppose that boy did?</p>

<p>Why, he went back to his room, and with his sister's brush
and color box he painted red spots on his face, just as he had
seen them on the face of the real Measles Boy across the street.
Then this boy put the paints away and waited.</p>

<p>After a while Mother called:</p>

<p>"Come, Boysie! Time to get up and go to school!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't guess I'd better go to school this morning," said
the boy, trying to make his voice sound weak and ill and faint-like.</p>

<p>"Not go to school! Why not?" cried Mother in surprise.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm all red spots," the boy answered. And when his
mother went in his room, and saw that he really was spotted,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, you <i>have</i> the measles! I didn't think they'd break
out so <i>soon</i>! Well, you must stay in the dark on account of
your eyes. I'll bring you in some breakfast, and of course you
can't go to school!"</p>

<p>Then that boy had to put the bedquilt over his mouth so he
wouldn't laugh. If his room had been light his mother, of
course, would have seen that the spots were only red paint.
But in the dimness of early morning she didn't see.</p>

<p>"Isn't Brother going to school?" asked Sister as she ate her
breakfast.</p>

<p>"He has the measles," said Mother. "I expect you'll come
down with them next, and break out in a day or so. But wait
until you do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
And if Sister thought anything about her red paint she said
nothing. I don't believe she ever imagined her brother would
play such a trick.</p>

<p>At first, after his sister had gone to school, and he had been
given his breakfast in bed, the boy thought it was going to be
lots of fun to pretend to have the measles and stay home from
school. But after a while this began to grow tiresome.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful, warm sunshiny day outside, and staying
in a dark room wasn't as much fun as that boy had thought. He
could hear the bees humming outside his open window, and
the birds were singing.</p>

<p>His mother opened the door and spoke to him.</p>

<p>"I'm just going across the street a few minutes," she said.
"You'll be all right, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," answered the boy. "My measles don't hurt hardly
any."</p>

<p>And of course they couldn't, being only painted measles, you
know.</p>

<p>When Mother went away, softly closing the door after her,
the sound of the buzzing bees and the singing birds came to
the boy through his window. He knew it must be lovely outside,
and yet he had to stay in bed.</p>

<p>"But I can get up and run out for a little while," he said to
himself. "Mother will never know!"</p>

<p>No sooner thought of than done! The boy quickly put on
some clothes&mdash;not many, for it was summer&mdash;and out into the
yard he went, his face all red paint spots. He didn't dare wash
them off or his mother would have noticed.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Uncle Wiggily, the bunny rabbit gentleman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
was out that day, taking a walk with Grandfather
Goosey Gander. The two friends passed through the woods,
close to the edge of the yard of the house where the make-believe
Measles Boy lived. And the boy saw the bunny gentleman, all
dressed up as Uncle Wiggily was. Grandpa Goosey, also, had
on his coat and trousers. Uncle Wiggily wore his golf suit that
day&mdash;black and white checkered trousers and a cap.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/p126_650.jpg" width="650" height="460" alt="Hop faster! quacked Grandpa" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, what a funny rabbit! What a funny goose!" cried the
boy. "I'm going to catch 'em and have a play circus in my
yard!"</p>

<p>Forgetting that he was supposed to be suffering from measles,
this boy chased after Uncle Wiggily and Grandpa Goosey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
"We'd better run," quacked the goose gentleman. "Boy,
you know! Chase us! Throw stones, you know. Better run;
what?"</p>

<p>"I believe you!" answered Uncle Wiggily. "Run it is!"</p>

<p>Off hopped the bunny! Off waddled the goose! But the boy
was a fast runner, in spite of the red spots on his face and he
came nearer and nearer to Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he's going to catch me, Grandpa!" spoke Mr.
Longears in animal talk, of course, which the boy could not
hear, much less understand.</p>

<p>"Hop faster!" quacked Grandpa, who was half running and
half flying.</p>

<p>On came the boy! Grandpa Goosey, who was ahead, looked
back and saw that Uncle Wiggily was soon going to be caught.</p>

<p>"There is only one way to save the bunny," thought Grandpa
Goosey. "I'll splash some water in that boy's face and eyes so
he can't see for a moment. Then Uncle Wiggily and I can
get away!"</p>

<p>Near the path along which the boy was chasing the bunny
and goose was a puddle of water. As quick as a wink Grandpa
Goosey splashed into this, and, with his wings and webbed feet,
he sent such a shower of water into the face of the boy that the
bad chap had to stop.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ouch! Stop splashing me!" cried the boy. His face
was all wet, but he wiped it off on his sleeve, and with his handkerchief.
And when he had cleared his eyes of water he started
to run again.</p>

<p>But by this time Uncle Wiggily and Grandpa Goosey were
far off, hidden in the forest, and the boy could not find them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
"I guess I'd better go back home and get into bed," thought
the boy. "Mother will be looking for me."</p>

<p>He was just going in the house when his mother came up the
steps.</p>

<p>"Why, Boysie!" exclaimed Mother. "You shouldn't have
gone out with the measles! Why&mdash;where <i>are</i> your measles?"
she asked, for the spots were gone. "Your face is all red, like
a lobster; but you haven't any more measles spots! What happened?"</p>

<p>The boy remembered the water that Grandpa Goosey had
splashed up from the puddle. He took out his handkerchief
and looked at it. That, too, was red!</p>

<p>"Why, it's <i>red paint</i>!" cried Mother. "Oh, Boysie! How
could you play such a trick?" and she felt so sad that tears came
into her eyes. "What made you do it, Boysie?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't want to go to school," the boy answered, softly
and much ashamed.</p>

<p>"Oh, how foolish of you!" said Mother. "Now I'll have to
take you to school myself, but I won't tell teacher what you
did&mdash;that is, I will not if you study your lessons well."</p>

<p>"I will, Mother! I will!" the make-believe Measles Boy
promised. "I'll never want to stay home from school again!"</p>

<p>And he never did&mdash;even when he really had the measles
which broke out on him about a week later. But he did not have
them very hard, though he didn't need any of his sister's paints
to make red spots.</p>

<p>And when Grandpa Goosey looked in the window of the
boy's house, and saw the little chap with his face all speckled,
the goose gentleman said:</p>

<p>"Serves him right for chasing Uncle Wiggily and me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Well, perhaps it did. Who knows? Anyhow, if it should
happen that the doorknob doesn't turn around and try to crawl
through the keyhole when the milk bottle chases the pussy cat
off the back stoop, then I may tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and the chicken-pox.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CHICKEN-POX</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One day Charlie and Arabella Chick, the little rooster and
hen children of Mrs. Cluck-Cluck, the hen lady, came fluttering
over to Uncle Wiggily's hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" cackled Arabella. "What you think
has happened?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hardly am able to guess," answered the bunny gentleman.
"I do hope, though, that your coop isn't on fire. You
seem much excited, my dears!"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'd be excited, too, if a boy threw stones
at you!" crowed Charlie. "Wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I would," admitted Uncle Wiggily. "Once a boy
did stone me and I didn't like it at all."</p>

<p>"We don't like it either," cawed Arabella.</p>

<p>"Isn't there some way you can stop that boy from throwing
sticks and stones at us?" Charlie wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," suggested Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Well, it's this way," began Arabella. "This boy lives on
the other side of the Big Forest. Sometimes Charlie and I go
over there to pick up beechnuts and other good things to eat,
and every time that boy sees us he pegs things at us! Wouldn't
you call him a bad boy, Uncle Wiggily?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
"Most surely I would," answered the rabbit gentleman.
"But why does he do it? You don't crow over him; do you,
Charlie?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," answered the rooster boy. "I only crow to
warn Arabella when I see that fellow coming, to tell her to
run and hide under a bush."</p>

<p>"And I don't pick him, or scratch gravel at him or anything
like that," cackled the little hen girl. "I wish he'd let us alone,
Uncle Wiggily."</p>

<p>"We came over to see if you could think up a way to make
him stop," crowed Charlie. "Can you?"</p>

<p>"Hum! I'll try," promised the bunny gentleman, twinkling
his pink nose like the frosting on top of an orange shortcake.
"Suppose we go look for this boy," went on Uncle Wiggily.
"So I'll know him when I see him."</p>

<p>"I can show you his house," offered Charlie. "But we'll have
to be careful. For if he sees us he'll peg things at us."</p>

<p>"Let us hope not," murmured Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>But it was a vain hope, as they say in fairy books. For after
Uncle Wiggily, Charlie and Arabella had gone to the other side
of a forest, there, all of a sudden, they saw the boy.</p>

<p>"Hi! There are those funny dressed-up chickens!" shouted
the boy, who had red hair, and a face full of freckles. "And
there's a rabbit with them, all dressed up in a tall silk hat! Oh,
my! What style! I'm going to see if I can knock his hat off
with a stone! I'm going to peg rocks at 'em!"</p>

<p>"See! What did I tell you?" cackled Arabella, who could
understand boy-talk, as could also Charlie and Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
"Bang!" bounced a stone on Uncle Wiggily's tall silk hat,
sending it spinning through the air.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed the boy, as he picked up another stone.
"I'm a good shot, I am!"</p>

<p>"I should call that rather a <i>bad</i> shot&mdash;for my hat," remarked
Uncle Wiggily, as he picked up his silk hat and hopped toward
the bushes. "Come on, Arabella and Charlie!" called the bunny
gentleman. "This boy is acting just as you said he did. I
must think up some way of teaching him a lesson!"</p>

<p>The little hen girl and rooster boy scooted under the bushes,
and only just in time, for the boy threw many more stones, and
one struck Charlie on the comb. Not the comb that he used to
make his feathers smooth, but the red comb on his head&mdash;one of
his ornaments; his tail feathers being others.</p>

<p>"Hi, fellows! Come on chase the funny chickens and the
dressed-up rabbit!" cried the boy. But though some of his
chums ran up, as he called, with sticks and stones, Uncle Wiggily,
with Charlie and Arabella, managed to hide away from
the thoughtless lads. For they were thoughtless. They didn't
think that stones hurt animals.</p>

<p>"Yes, I certainly must teach that boy a lesson," said Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish he'd catch the chicken-pox!" crowed Charlie. "Or
maybe the roosterpox! Then he'd have to stay in and couldn't
chase us!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care if he had the mumps and toothache at the
same time!" cackled Arabella.</p>

<p>For several days Uncle Wiggily watched for a chance to
teach the thoughtless boy a lesson, and at last it came. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
bunny gentleman was out hopping in the woods one morning
when he met Charlie and Arabella fluttering along the forest
path.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/p133_650.jpg" width="650" height="412" alt="The boy was asleep under a tree" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" said Arabella in a cackling whisper.
"That boy is asleep now, on a bed of moss under a tree. He's
sleeping hard, too, for Charlie and I went close to him and he
didn't awaken. Maybe you can do something to him now."</p>

<p>"Maybe I can," said Uncle Wiggily. "I'll go see!"</p>

<p>He hopped through the woods with the chicken children, and
soon came to where the boy was asleep under a tree. It was a
pine tree, with sticky gum oozing from the trunk and branches.
And as soon as the bunny gentleman saw this gum he whispered:</p>

<p>"I have an idea! I'll teach this boy a lesson."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Charlie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'll make him think he has the chicken-pox, or something
worse," answered the bunny, with a silent laugh.</p>

<p>"Goodie!" cackled Arabella.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" crowed Charlie.</p>

<p>"Quiet now, chicken children," whispered Uncle Wiggily.
"Each of you pull me out a few loose feathers."</p>

<p>Charlie and Arabella did this. Then the bunny uncle took
some of the soft gum from the pine tree, and put spots of it on
the face and hands of the sleeping boy. Though he stirred a
little, the boy did not awaken.</p>

<p>When the boy was well spotted with the sticky gum, Uncle
Wiggily took the chicken feathers that Charlie and Arabella
had plucked, and fastened these feathers on the boy's face and
hands in the gum.</p>

<p>"Oh, how funny he looks!" softly cackled Arabella.</p>

<p>"Hush!" cautioned Uncle Wiggily, putting his paw on his
pink, twinkling nose. "Let him sleep!"</p>

<p>Drawing back into the bushes, Uncle Wiggily, Charlie and
Arabella waited for the boy to awaken, which he did pretty
soon. He turned over, sat up and stretched. Then he looked
at his hands, and saw chicken feathers stuck on them.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried the boy. "What has happened to
me?"</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet and caught sight of himself in a spring
of water that was like a looking glass.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried the boy again. "This is terrible! Oh, my
face!"</p>

<p>Home he ran through the woods, while Charlie and Arabella
laughed to see him go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
"Oh, Mother! Mother! Look at me!" cried the boy. "I'm
all feathers! I must have the chicken-pox!"</p>

<p>"Goodness me, sakes alive and a basket of eggs!" exclaimed
the boy's mother. "You must have gone to sleep in a hen's
nest! But you haven't the chicken-pox! The chicken-pox is
spots like the measles, but you are covered with <i>feathers</i>!"</p>

<p>"But how did I get this way?" asked the boy, as he pulled
off some of the feathers. "I wasn't like it when I went to sleep
in the woods."</p>

<p>"Maybe a fairy did it," spoke his little sister, who believed
in them.</p>

<p>"Pooh! There aren't any fairies!" sneered the boy. "I guess
it was that hen and rooster I stoned."</p>

<p>"Did you do that?" asked his mother. "Did you?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a little!" stammered the boy.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't any wonder you're this way, then," Mother
said. "And, for all I know, you may get the real chicken-pox!"</p>

<p>And, as true as I'm telling you that boy did! But he was
not made very ill, for some reason or other. Perhaps because
he had to be washed so clean, to get off the sticky pine gum and
the feathers, the chicken-pox didn't go in very deeply.</p>

<p>At any rate, when the boy was all well again, he threw no
more stones at Charlie or Arabella.</p>

<p>"You cured him, Uncle Wiggily!" crowed the rooster boy.</p>

<p>And I really think the bunny did. So if toy balloon doesn't
take the spout off the teakettle to blow beans through at the
egg beater, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily's Hallowe'en.</p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX">STORY XX</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY'S HALLOWE'EN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Hopping along under the bushes one day, near the edge of
the forest nearest to where lived the real boys and girls, Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit gentleman, heard two
boys talking together.</p>

<p>"We'll put a tick-tack on her window," said the First Boy.</p>

<p>"And she'll be scared stiff!" said the Second Boy. "Oh, what
fun we'll have this Hallowe'en!"</p>

<p>"Hum!" thought the bunny rabbit gentleman to himself,
after hearing this. "It may be fun for <i>you</i>, but how about whoever
it is you're going to scare stiff? I only hope it isn't my
nice muskrat lady housekeeper, Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily twinkled his pink nose, and listened with
both ears.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the First Boy, "we'll have a lot of fun this
Hallowe'en with tick-tacks and the like of that! And we'll put
on false faces so the Little Old Lady of Mulberry Lane won't
know us!"</p>

<p>"Oh ho! So that's the one they're going to play tricks on;
is it?" thought Uncle Wiggily to himself. "The Little Old
Lady of Mulberry Lane! I know her&mdash;poor creature; she lives
all alone, and she may have a cupboard, like Old Mother Hubbard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
but she hasn't a dog or a bone. I suppose," thought Uncle
Wiggily, "that Jackie or Peetie Bow Wow would stay with
her, if she wanted them. I must see about it."</p>

<p>"But, first of all, I must plan some way so these mischievous
boys won't put a tick-tack on the window of the Little Old Lady
of Mulberry Lane. I know what tick-tacks are!"</p>

<p>And well Uncle Wiggily knew, for sometimes the boys and
girls of Woodland, near the Orange Ice Mountains, where the
bunny had built his hollow stump bungalow, put one of the
scary things on his window. That is, they were scary if you
didn't know what they were, but Uncle Wiggily did.</p>

<p>Oftentimes Sammie Littletail, the rabbit, or Johnnie and
Billie Bushytail, the squirrels, would take some string, a pin
and an old nail, or little stone, and make a tick-tack. They fastened
a short piece of string to the pin, and on the other end of
the string they tied a dangling stone. When it grew dark the
animal chaps would sneak up to Uncle Wiggily's window, and
stick the pin in the wooden sash so the stone, or nail, hung
dangling down against the glass. Then they would tie the long
string, or thread, about half way down on the short cord and
hide off in the bushes, with one end of the long string in their
paws.</p>

<p>From their hiding place the animal boys would pull the long
string. The pebble, or stone, would rattle against Uncle Wiggily's
window, making a sound like:</p>

<p>"Tick! Tack!"</p>

<p>That's how it got its name, you see.</p>

<p>"So they are going to play tick-tack on the Little Old Lady
of Mulberry Lane; are they?" said Uncle Wiggily to himself,
as the two boys walked away. "Well, I must try to stop them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Mulberry Lane was a street near the forest where the bunny
gentleman lived in his hollow stump bungalow, and the Little
Old Lady was the only one whose house was built there. The
bunny liked the Little Old Lady, for in winter she scattered
crumbs for the birds.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily hopped home to his hollow stump, and from
the attic he took down one of his old, tall silk hats.</p>

<p>"What in the world are you doing, Uncle Wiggily?" asked
Nurse Jane. "Do you think it is April Fool, and are you going
to wear an old hat so the animal boys won't play tricks
on you?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly," the bunny answered. "I'll tell you
later, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy&mdash;if it works."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she saw Mr.
Longears put in his pocket some pieces of white paper and a pot
of paste. "I do believe he's going to fly a kite&mdash;and on Hallowe'en
of all nights!"</p>

<p>For it quickly became Hallowe'en night. As soon as the
dusky shadows of evening began to fall, strange figures flitted
to and fro, not only in the woods of the animal folk, but on the
other side, in the village where the real boys and girls lived.</p>

<p>Real boys, with the heads of wolves, the faces of clowns and
some as black as the charcoal-man skipped here and there, ringing
doorbells, outlining in chalk on the steps something that
looked like an envelope, or else they tapped on windows with
long sticks so that when the windows were opened no one could
be seen.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily, hopping off through the darkness toward the
edge of the forest, carried with him one of Nurse Jane's old
brooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
an old, tall silk hat and a coat the bunny gentleman
had, long ago, tried to throw in the rag bag. Only Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy wouldn't let him.</p>

<p>"I'll mend it, sew on some new buttons and it will be as good
as ever," she said. Well, Uncle Wiggily found this coat and
took it with him.</p>

<p>"I'll stop those boys from putting a tick-tack on the window
of the Little Old Lady of Mulberry Lane," thought the bunny
as he hopped along. "I'll tick-tack them!"</p>

<p>He kept in the shadows of the trees so none of the animal
children saw him. But the bunny gentleman saw them. He
saw Neddie Stubtail, the boy bear, dressed up like the Pipsisewah.
And Billie Wagtail, the goat, had on a false face just
like the skinny Skeezicks.</p>

<p>Here and there animal girls were hurrying to Hallowe'en
parties. Lulu and Alice Wibblewobble, the ducks, were giving
one, and Baby Bunty, the little rabbit girl, had been invited to
"bob" for carrots at the house of Buddy and Brighteyes, the
guinea pigs.</p>

<p>Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, who were dressed in clown
suits, hurrying to have fun with Johnnie and Billie Bushytail,
the squirrels, caught sight of Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Come and have some Hallowe'en fun with us!" barked
Jackie.</p>

<p>"I will in a little while," promised the bunny.</p>

<p>On and on he hopped, and soon he came to the house of the
Little Old Lady of Mulberry Lane. The bunny could look in
her window and see her reading a book by the light of a
candle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
"I'll hide under her window," thought the bunny, "and when
those boys come with the tick-tack&mdash;well, we'll see what happens!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily did not have long to wait. Pretty soon he
heard a rustling in the bushes and some whisperings.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" thought Mr. Longears. He put the extra
tall silk hat on top of the broom, and fastened his old coat to
the handle, on a cross-stick he had nailed there. Then, taking
the pieces of white paper from his pocket, Uncle Wiggily pasted
them on the shiny part of the old silk hat in the shape of a grinning
Jack o' Lantern face. Then the bunny crouched down behind
the bushes with the scarecrow he had made.</p>

<p>"You sneak up and fasten on the tick-tack," whispered one
boy, "and I'll pull the string so it will rattle and scare the Old
Lady stiff!"</p>

<p>"I want to pull the string, too!" said the other boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can, after you fasten on the tick-tack."</p>

<p>"Well, give it here then," said the second boy.</p>

<p>They were so close to the bush, behind which Uncle Wiggily
was hidden, that the bunny could have reached out and touched
them with his paw if he had wished.</p>

<p>But he didn't do that. Instead, Uncle Wiggily suddenly
lifted up the broom, dressed as it was in the old coat and the
tall hat with the grinning, white paper face like a Jack o'
Lantern.</p>

<p>"Boo-oo-oo-bunk!" groaned the bunny rabbit, scary-like.</p>

<p>The boys, who were just getting ready to frighten the Little
Old Lady of Mulberry Lane, jumped up in fright themselves.
They saw the queer face laughing at them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
"Oh, it's a Hallowe'en hobgoblin! A hobgoblin!" cried one
boy.</p>

<p>"Come on! Come on!" shouted the other. "Let's get out
of here!" And dropping string, tick-tack and everything, away
they ran. They never knew that it was only a bunny rabbit
gentleman who had surprised them.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed Uncle Wiggily, as he peered out from
behind the broomstick and the scary tall-hat creature he had
made. "I guess they won't bother the Old Lady now!"</p>

<p>The Little Old Lady of Mulberry Lane laid aside the book
she had been reading and opened her door.</p>

<p>"Is anybody there?" she gently asked, looking out over her
dark garden. "Seems to me I heard a noise-like. Is anybody
there, trying to play Hallowe'en tricks on a poor, lone body like
me? Anybody there?"</p>

<p>No one answered&mdash;not even Uncle Wiggily&mdash;for he couldn't
speak real talk, you know. But he heard what the Old Lady
said.</p>

<p>"Nobody there! I guess it must have been the wind," said
the Little Old Lady of Mulberry Lane, as she shut the door.</p>

<p>But we know it wasn't the wind; don't we?</p>

<p>Then the bunny hopped back to his own part of the forest,
to have Hallowe'en fun with the animal boys and girls. The
frightened boys ran home and jumped into bed. And if the
piano key doesn't unlock the door of the phonograph, and let
all the music run down the pussy cat's tail, you may next hear
of Uncle Wiggily and the poor dog.</p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI">STORY XXI</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE POOR DOG</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a dog so poor that he had no
kennel to sleep in. He made his bed in old boxes and barrels
along the street, or behind stores. And as for things to eat&mdash;that
poor dog thought himself lucky if he found a bone without
any meat on it! Oh, he was dreadfully poor, was that dog!</p>

<p>He had no collar to wear, though of course he did not miss a
necktie, for dogs never wear those. But when this dog saw
other dogs, with shiny brass or nickel collars around their necks,
when he saw some of them riding in automobiles as he splashed
through the mud, and when he looked over in yards and saw
some dogs gnawing juicy, meaty bones in front of their warm
kennels&mdash;this poor dog sometimes felt sad.</p>

<p>"I don't see what use I am in this world," thought the poor
dog, as he chased away a tickling fly who wanted to ride on his
tail. "I certainly can't help anyone, for I can hardly help myself!
I think I'll go off in the woods and get lost! Yes, that's
what I'll do," barked the poor dog. "Get lost!"</p>

<p>Perhaps if he had had a good breakfast that morning, with
a biscuit or two, or even a slice of puppy cake, he might have
been more happy. As it was, after crawling out of an empty
rain-water barrel, where he had slept all night, and after finding
only a small bone for his breakfast, this dog went off to the
woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
"Good-bye, everybody!" he softly barked, as he stood on the
edge of the forest, and looked back toward the village he was
leaving. But there was no one even to bark a farewell to him.
All alone the poor dog started into the woods. "Good-bye!"
he whined.</p>

<p>Now in this same forest, on the opposite side from the trees
nearest the village, stood the hollow stump bungalow of Uncle
Wiggily Longears. And this same morning that the poor dog
decided to lose himself, the bunny rabbit gentleman started out
with his tall, silk hat, his red, white and blue striped rheumatism
crutch, and his pink twinkling nose to look for an adventure.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes open for the Woozie Wolf or the Fuzzy
Fox!" called Nurse Jane, the muskrat lady housekeeper as Mr.
Longears hopped away.</p>

<p>"I will!" promised the bunny uncle.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily hopped along and along and along, looking
behind bushes and rocks for an adventure when, all of a sudden,
he saw a sort of hole down in between two logs.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is an adventure down in there for me," said
the rabbit gentleman. "I'll poke my paw down in and find out.
This hole isn't large enough to be the den of the Fox or Wolf."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily thrust one of his forepaws down into the hole,
and began feeling around between the logs. He touched something
soft and fuzzy, and he was just beginning to think that
perhaps Baby Bunty was hiding down there so he couldn't tag
her when, all of a quickness, those logs rolled together. Before
Uncle Wiggily could pull out his paw it was caught fast, and
there he was, held just as if he were in a trap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
"Oh, my goodness me, sakes alive, and a basket of soap
bubbles!" cried the bunny rabbit gentleman. "I'm caught!
How dreadful! I must get out!"</p>

<p>Well, he pulled and he pulled and he pulled, but still his
paw was held fast. He scrabbled around among the dried
leaves, he tried to lift one log off the other with his rheumatism
crutch, and he tried to gnaw a hole in the top log that held him
fast. But it was all of no use.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm afraid I'll have to stay here forever, unless I get
help!" thought Uncle Wiggily. "But I must call for aid! Perhaps
Grandpa Goosey, or Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, will hear
me!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/p144_650.jpg" width="650" height="452" alt="Who calls for help?" />
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily stopped his pink nose from twinkling, so that
he could call more loudly, and then he shouted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
"Help! Help! Help!"</p>

<p>For a time there was no answer, only the wind blowing among
the leaves of the trees. And then, all at once, there was a
rustling in the bushes and a voice asked:</p>

<p>"Who calls for help?"</p>

<p>"I do," answered Uncle Wiggily. "Oh, even if you are the
Woozie Wolf or the Fuzzy Fox, please help me!"</p>

<p>"I am neither the Wolf nor the Fox," was the answer. "I
am only a poor dog who came to this forest to lose himself. I
never have been able yet to help anyone."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you can help me," said Uncle Wiggily, as
cheerfully as he could speak. "Come here and see where the
logs have fallen on my paw, holding me fast."</p>

<p>So the poor dog, with his ragged clothes which made him look
almost like a tramp, came through the bushes, close to Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"My, but you're stylish!" said the dog, as he saw Uncle Wiggily's
tall, silk hat.</p>

<p>"That isn't anything," sadly said the bunny rabbit gentleman.
"Tall hats do not make for happiness. I'd rather have
on an old, ragged cap, like yours, and be free, than wear a diamond
and gold crown like a king and be held fast here."</p>

<p>"Yes, it isn't fun to be caught in a trap," barked the poor
dog. "But I think I can gnaw through one of those logs and
set you free."</p>

<p>Then he began to gnaw. He gnawed and he gnawed and
he gnawed, and, in a little while, one of the logs was cut in
two, just as if it had been sawed, and Uncle Wiggily could
pull out his paw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"I can't tell you how thankful I am," said the bunny to the
dog. "What fine, strong white teeth you have. How did you
get them?"</p>

<p>"From gnawing bones without any soft meat on them, I suppose,"
answered the dog. "Poor dogs must have strong teeth,
or they would starve. Rich dogs, who get soft food, can afford
to have soft teeth."</p>

<p>"Well, then I am very glad you are a poor dog!" laughed
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"You are?" barked the other, in great surprise.</p>

<p>"Certainly; of course I am!" exclaimed the bunny. "Just
think! Suppose you had been one of those rich dogs, with soft,
crumbly teeth! You would not have been able to gnaw through
the log and I would still be held fast."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," agreed the dog, wagging his tail. "I never
thought of that."</p>

<p>"Then be thankful, as I am, that you are poor, and have
strong teeth," went on Mr. Longears. "You have been of great
help to me."</p>

<p>"Have I?" barked the dog. "Then I am very glad! I never
before helped anyone. I thought I was too poor!"</p>

<p>"Well, you aren't going to be poor any more," went on the
bunny rabbit gentleman. "Come to the woods and live near
my hollow stump bungalow. I have a friend, Old Dog Percival,
who will let you stay in his kennel. He is rich!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that makes me very happy!" said the dog, who used to
be poor. "I have always wanted a kennel to live in!"</p>

<p>Then he went home with the bunny rabbit. And, though
he never became a very rich dog, still he had a warm kennel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
which Percival shared with him, and he always had enough to
eat; and he became great friends with Mr. Longears and Nurse
Jane.</p>

<p>So this teaches us that even if a lollypop has a stick this does
not mean it needs a whipping. And if the sunflower doesn't
shine so brightly in the eyes of the potato that it can't see to get
out of the oven, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
the rich cat.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE RICH CAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a very rich cat, but with all she
had she was not happy. She owned an automobile and kept a
little mouse servant girl to wait on her. And an old gentleman
rat did all the heavy work around the house, such as putting
out the ashes and cutting the grass.</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho!" sighed the rich cat lady one morning, after she
had lapped up some thick, heavy cream, which was left on her
doorstep each day. "Heigh-ho! I am so tired!"</p>

<p>"Tired of what?" squeaked the little mouse servant, as she
brought a paper napkin for the rich cat to wipe the cream from
her whiskers. Even though she was well-off, the cat lady had
whiskers, and she was very proud of them.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am tired of sitting around doing nothing!" purred
the rich cat.</p>

<p>"Then why not go for a ride in your auto?" asked the poor
little mouse servant girl.</p>

<p>"I am tired of that, too," spoke the rich cat. "It is the same
old thing every day! Dress and go out. Come back and dress
to eat! Dress to go out again! Come back and undress to go
to bed and get up in the morning to dress and do it all over
again! I&mdash;I'd like to have an <i>adventure</i>!" mewed the cat lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
"Oh, mercy! An <i>adventure</i>!" squeaked the mouse.
"Never!"</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the cat, "a real, exciting adventure. I saw
a poor dog the other day&mdash;at least he used to be poor, and he
is far from rich now. But he looked so well, and so lively, with
such strong, white teeth! I heard him telling another dog he
had had a most wonderful adventure in the woods with an old
rabbit gentleman named Uncle Wiggily. I quite envied that
poor dog!"</p>

<p>"Oh, and you so rich!" murmured the mousie girl.</p>

<p>"I don't care!" mewed the wealthy cat lady. "I'd almost be
willing to be poor if I could have an adventure. Come, I'll go
for a ride in the auto. It will be better than dawdling around
the house."</p>

<p>So the cat lady ordered out her auto, with the rat gentleman
to drive it, and the little mousie girl to sit beside her on the
cushioned seat.</p>

<p>"Where shall I drive to, Lady Cat?" asked the old gentleman
rat chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere&mdash;to the woods&mdash;the fields&mdash;anywhere so that
I may have an adventure&mdash;I don't care!" mewed the rich cat.</p>

<p>So the rat gentleman drove the auto through the village, and
out into the forest. At first the roads were very good, but at
last they became bumpy, and the cat lady and mousie girl were
much shaken up and jiggled about, not to say joggled.</p>

<p>"Do you want to go on?" asked the rat.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered the cat. "It shakes up my liver, and I
seem to be feeling more hungry. Go on, perhaps I shall find
an adventure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
The auto lurched and bumped on a little farther and, all of
a sudden there was a crash.</p>

<p>"Oh!" screamed the little mousie girl.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the cat lady, looking through
her fancy glasses.</p>

<p>"We have had an accident," answered the gentleman rat.
"The auto is broken, and I shall have to go for help."</p>

<p>"Let us go, also," squeaked the mousie girl. "We don't want
to stay here in the woods alone."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> may not want to," said the cat with a smile. "But <i>I</i>
am going to. Run along with Mr. Rat, Miss Mouse, and get
help. I'll stay here!"</p>

<p>So the rich cat lady was left alone, sitting in the auto, one
wheel of which was broken, while the rat gentleman and mousie
girl went to look for a garage where they could get help.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this is the start of an adventure," thought the cat.</p>

<p>A moment later she heard a rustling in the bushes, and out
popped a strange dog. Now the rich cat lady knew some rich
dogs who wore silver and gold collars, and were friends of
hers. She was not afraid of them. But this was a dog without
any collar, though he had on a suit of clothes. And, when the
cat lady looked a second time, she saw that it was a boy dog
and not a grown man dog.</p>

<p>"Bow! wow!" barked the boy dog. "You're a strange cat!
What are you doing in these woods? Hi, Jackie!" howled the
dog. "Come help me chase this strange cat up a tree!"</p>

<p>"All right, Peetie! I'm with you!" answered a voice, and
out of the bushes came another boy dog. The two dogs rushed
at the cat lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Now she might not have been afraid of <i>one</i> boy dog, but
when <i>two</i> of them leaped toward her, this was enough to
frighten almost any pussy! Don't you think so?</p>

<p>"Meaouw! Mew! Mee!" cried the cat, and before she knew
it she was climbing a tree. Up she scrabbled, her claws tearing
off bits of bark, until she was perched on a limb, high above her
auto and the barking dogs down below.</p>

<p>"My goodness me, sakes alive, and a liver cream puff!" said
the excited rich cat lady to herself, her heart beating like an
alarm clock. "This is dreadful! To think of me, a wealthy
cat, being chased up a tree by two poor dogs! What will my
friends think?"</p>

<p>Then she looked down at the dogs and said:</p>

<p>"Run away if you please, little puppy boys!"</p>

<p>"No! No!" they barked. "Bow! Wow!"</p>

<p>"You run and tell him," said one puppy to the other. "Tell
him there's a strange cat in his woods. I'll stay here at the
foot of the tree so she can't get down until you come back with
him!"</p>

<p>"I wonder whom they are going to bring back?" thought the
rich cat up the tree. And she could not help laughing a little
as she thought how strange she must look. "The mouse servant
and rat chauffeur will be surprised when they come back and
see me here," thought the cat.</p>

<p>One little puppy dog boy ran away, while the other remained
on guard at the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>"May I come down?" asked the cat lady.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" growled the dog, though he did not speak impolitely.
"You must stay up there!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
"Dear me!" thought the cat lady. "This is quite an unexpected
adventure!"</p>

<p>All of a sudden she saw the puppy at the foot of the tree
jump up. At the same time there was a rustling in the bushes,
and along came the other puppy, with an old gentleman rabbit,
who wore a tall silk hat, who had a pair of glasses on his pink,
twinkling nose and who walked with a red, white and blue
striped rheumatism crutch.</p>

<p>"There she is, Uncle Wiggily!" barked a puppy dog. "We
saw her in your woods, and chased her up a tree until you could
look at her. Maybe she is the Woozie Wolf or the Fuzzy Fox,
dressed up like a cat."</p>

<p>"Indeed I am not," said the rich pussy lady up the tree. "I
am the Rich Mrs. Cat, and my auto has broken. When my
mousie servant girl and the rat gentleman who drives my car
return, they will tell you I never harm rabbits. But are you
Uncle Wiggily Longears?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the bunny, "I am. And I know you, Mrs.
Cat. I heard about you from the poor dog. I am very sorry
Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow chased you up a tree. They meant
no harm."</p>

<p>"I am sure they did not," mewed the cat politely.</p>

<p>"But they are always on the lookout so nothing will happen
to me," went on Uncle Wiggily. "I would get up and help
you down, only I can't climb a tree."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can easily get down," said the cat lady, and she did,
though her rich clothes were rather ruffled. But she had plenty
of money to buy more. So don't worry about that.</p>

<p>"Make yourself at home in these woods&mdash;the animal folk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
call them mine," said Uncle Wiggily kindly. "I am sorry you
had this trouble. Now I must hop away. I hope your auto will
soon be mended. Come, Jackie and Peetie, if you want to help
me."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked the rich cat.</p>

<p>"To help a poor cat family," said Uncle Wiggily. "The cat
gentleman of the house has been out of work a long time, his
wife is ill and he has a number of little kittens. I was on my
way to see the family when Jackie came to tell me you were up
a tree."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm down the tree now," laughed the rich cat lady.
"And will you please let me help this poor family? I have a
lot of money&mdash;see!" and she showed a purse full of golden
leaves which the animal folk use for money. "I can buy them
food, and if Mr. Cat wants work, let him take my auto, after it
is fixed, and use it for a jitney."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Uncle Wiggily. "Aren't you going to use
that fine car any more? All it needs is a new wheel."</p>

<p>"Give it to the poor cat," was the answer. "I am never going
to ride in it again. I feel so much better since I came to the
woods&mdash;and climbed a tree&mdash;that I am going to live here for
the rest of my life. I'll buy a hollow stump bungalow near
you, Uncle Wiggily. I know, now, I am going to be very
happy."</p>

<p>"Well, you will make the poor cat family happy, at any rate,"
said Mr. Longears.</p>

<p>"And to make others happy is to be happy yourself," mewed
the rich cat lady.</p>

<p>She went with Uncle Wiggily, Jackie and Peetie to the home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of the poor cat family, and when the worried cat gentleman
heard that he was to have the auto for a jitney, with which he
could make money, he was so glad he almost stood on his head.
And his wife and the kitten children were glad also.</p>

<p>When the rat gentleman chauffeur and the mousie servant
girl came back, in another auto, to take the rich lady home, she
said:</p>

<p>"I am going to stay with Uncle Wiggily. From now on I am
going to live in the woods and be happy and poor."</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" squeaked the mousie servant. "Just fancy!"</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing," said the rat gentleman.
"You had much better come home and live as you did before."</p>

<p>But the cat lady would not change her mind, and she built
herself a bungalow near Uncle Wiggily's, and lived there happily
forever after.</p>

<p>So from this we may learn, if we will, that when a pail leaks
it is best to have it mended. And if the hand-organ monkey
doesn't take the squeak out of the rubber ball to make a tin
horn for the rag doll, the next story will be about Uncle Wiggily
and the horse.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE HORSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper
for Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit gentleman, once
baked a cherry pie, of which Mr. Longears was very fond. In
fact, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy baked <i>two</i> pies.</p>

<p>One she put upon the shelf for Uncle Wiggily's supper.
The other pie Nurse Jane wrapped in a clean napkin, put it in
a basket, and then she said:</p>

<p>"Come on, Uncle Wiggily. We will take this pie to Grandfather
Goosey Gander."</p>

<p>"That will be fine!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. So he set
off with Nurse Jane, over the fields and through the woods.
"And perhaps we may have an adventure," said the bunny gentleman,
hopeful-like.</p>

<p>"Well, if we do," spoke Nurse Jane, "I hope nothing happens
to this cherry pie. I baked one for you, and the other especially
for Grandpa Goosey. I shouldn't like the Fuzzy Fox, nor yet
the Woozie Wolf, to get this pie."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Uncle Wiggily. "And I don't believe Grandpa
Goosey would, either."</p>

<p>The rabbit gentleman and Nurse Jane hopped along together,
until, after a while, Uncle Wiggily saw a horse in a
>field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
"Look at that poor horse!" said the bunny gentleman, coming
to a stop, and peeping over the top of his pink, twinkling
nose. "There he stands, all day long, with nothing to eat but
grass."</p>

<p>"What else would he eat?" asked Nurse Jane, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose he ever had a cherry pie," went on Uncle
Wiggily reflective-like. "Poor horse! Never had any cherry
pie!"</p>

<p>"Wiggy!" exclaimed Nurse Jane, as she took a firmer hold
of the basket handle. "If you are thinking of giving Grandpa
Goosey's pie to that horse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, that's just what I'm thinking of," answered Mr.
Longears. "Here, Nurse Jane, please give me that pie. You
may run back home and get the one you were saving for me to
give to Grandpa Goosey. I'll call this pie mine, and I'm going
to give it to the horse."</p>

<p>"Well, I never in all my born days," exclaimed Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy, "heard the like of that!"</p>

<p>Still she knew Uncle Wiggily meant to be kind, so she
gave the bunny rabbit gentleman the basket with the pie inside,
and started back for the hollow stump bungalow to get
the other.</p>

<p>The bunny rabbit certainly was not selfish, whatever else he
was.</p>

<p>"Hello, Horsie!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he hopped
through the field where the big animal was eating.</p>

<p>"Hello," answered the horse. "Oh, it's Uncle Wiggily!" he
went on, as he stopped cropping the grass and looked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
"Did you ever eat a cherry pie?" asked the bunny rabbit, beginning
to take the cloth off the one in the basket.</p>

<p>"Cherry pie? I don't believe I ever did," slowly answered
the horse. "Cherry pie! Hum! No, I never tasted any."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to?" asked the bunny. "I should think
you would get tired of eating grass all day long."</p>

<p>"Well, grass is my food, and I like it," neighed the horse.
"But I like some oats once in a while, and some bran. Yes, and
I think I'd like some cherry pie, also."</p>

<p>"Here! Take this one! Nurse Jane can bake more!" said
generous Uncle Wiggily, and he held out the pie.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! That's a fine one!" whinnied the horse. "That
looks most delicious."</p>

<p>"And it tastes as delicious as it looks," went on the bunny.
"I know Nurse Jane's pies. Take a bite!"</p>

<p>The horse did. One bit was all that was needed to enable
him to eat the whole pie, for it was only rabbit size, of course,
not as large as the pies your mother bakes.</p>

<p>"Um!" said the horse, as the red cherry juice ran down his
lips. "That was a good pie! I could eat more!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but that's the only one I have," spoke Uncle Wiggily.
"Nurse Jane has gone to get mine, that she put in the
cupboard, to give to Grandpa Goosey. But to-morrow I'll have
her bake you a large pie."</p>

<p>Just then Nurse Jane came along, with the other pie in the
basket, and Uncle Wiggily said:</p>

<p>"The horse ate that cherry pie, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, and
liked it very much. I have told him you'd bake him a larger
one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
"Well, I s'pose I can," said the muskrat lady, looking at
Uncle Wiggily in a funny way. "I s'pose I can."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," neighed the horse. "If I could only
do you some favor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But just then, all of a sudden, out from behind a bush jumped
the bad old Woozie Wolf.</p>

<p>"Ah ha!" howled the Wolf. "This is the time I have caught
Nurse Jane as well as Uncle Wiggily. I shall have four ears
to nibble to-day!" and he looked hungrily at the bunny and
muskrat lady.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you are going to hurt good, kind Uncle
Wiggily, who has just given me a cherry pie?" asked the horse
quickly.</p>

<p>"Of course I am!" growled the Wolf. "He gave me no pie!
I'm going to nibble the bunny!"</p>

<p>"Well, I just won't let you!" said the horse.</p>

<p>"How are you going to stop me?" asked the Wolf.</p>

<p>"Well, I have big teeth," the horse said. "They are not as
sharp as yours, for they do not need to be so that I may crop the
grass. But I can bite you with them, just the same."</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho!" sneered the Wolf. "Two can play at that
game! I can bite worse than you."</p>

<p>"That's so, he can," whispered Uncle Wiggily to the horse.
"Be careful!"</p>

<p>"Well, then I'll <i>kick</i>!" said the horse. "I'll rear up on my
front legs and kick you with my hind ones, Mr. Wolf, if you
hurt Uncle Wiggily."</p>

<p>"But you have no sharp toe-nails, such as I have!" growled
the Wolf. "I'll scratch you with my toe-nails if you kick me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
"That's right&mdash;he will!" whispered Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you cannot save us," sadly said the bunny gentleman
to the kind horse.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can!" suddenly neighed the horse. "This Wolf can
do some things better than I, but he cannot run as fast. Quick!
Jump up on my back, Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane. I'll
gallop and trot, I'll gallop and trot and I'll gallop and trot&mdash;until
I take you far away from this bad animal!"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare take Uncle Wiggily away from me!" howled
the Wolf, for well he knew he could not run as fast as the
horse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/p159_650.jpg" width="650" height="455" alt="The wolf was left far, far, behind." />
</div>

<p>"Yes, I shall! I'll save Uncle Wiggily!" whinnied the
horse. "Up on my back! Quick!" he called to the bunny and
Nurse Jane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Up they leaped, before the Wolf could get them. Then the
horse galloped and trotted, galloped and trotted and galloped
and trotted, until the Wolf was left far, far behind. And, oh,
how angry that Wolf was! And how he howled! I wish you
could have heard him.</p>

<p>No, on second thought, it is just as well you didn't hear him.
It was not very nice howling.</p>

<p>"There! Now you are safe, Uncle Wiggily and Nurse
Jane," said the horse, as he stopped galloping and trotting,
away over on the far side of the field, far, far from the Wolf.</p>

<p>"Thank you for saving us," spoke the bunny, as he and Nurse
Jane slid off the horsie's back.</p>

<p>"I'll bake you the largest cherry pie that ever was," promised
the muskrat lady, "just as soon as I take this one to Grandpa
Goosey."</p>

<p>And she made such a large pie that it took the horse forty
'leven bites to eat it.</p>

<p>So everything came out all right, you see. And if the postman
doesn't try to slip a letter through the slot in the baby's
penny bank, and make the five cent piece jump over the dollar
bill, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the cow.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV">STORY XXIV</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE COW</span></h2>
</div>

<p>This is a story about Uncle Wiggily and the cow. Not the
cow with the crumpled horn, nor yet the one that jumped over
the moon, when the dish ran away with the spoon.</p>

<p>This was a sort of a red cow which ate green grass and gave
white milk that was churned into yellow butter to be eaten on
brown bread. There is no use asking me about all those colors
for I don't know&mdash;nobody knows. They're just there, and
that's all there is about it.</p>

<p>Now for the story.</p>

<p>One day the bunny rabbit gentleman was hopping over the
fields and through the woods on his way to the store for Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy. He was going to get his muskrat lady
housekeeper a jug of molasses so Nurse Jane might make a cake.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily hopped on and on, wondering if he would
have an adventure that day, and he was thinking how good
the molasses cake would taste when, all of a sudden, down in
a field he saw a red cow. Not exactly red like a rose, you understand,
or red like a barn, but still somewhat between those colors&mdash;a
brownish-red, I suppose it would be called.</p>

<p>"Moo! Moo! Moo!" called the cow, in such mournful tones
that Uncle Wiggily right away said:</p>

<p>"Something must be the matter! I'm going down and see
if I can help that poor cow!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Down into the meadow hopped the bunny rabbit gentleman,
and when he reached the cow he looked at her and she looked
at him, and the bunny asked:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Mrs. Cow?"</p>

<p>"Oh," was the sad answer, "I've lost the cud that I always
chew, and now I don't know what to do! I'm so upset I'm sure
I'll give sour milk to-night, instead of sweet!"</p>

<p>"That would be too bad," Uncle Wiggily remarked. "This
cud of yours&mdash;may I ask what it is?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/p162_640.jpg" width="640" height="460" alt="Well! Well! exclaimed Uncle Wiggily." />
</div>

<p>"Well, it isn't gum, as many boys and girls suppose, when
they see me chewing," spoke the cow lady. "My cud is a bunch
of grass, which I crop and pull up by winding my tongue about
it, for I haven't two sets of teeth as have many animals. I only
have teeth on my upper jaw. On my lower jaw I have no teeth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
but the gums are very hard so I can chew grass, and that is
what makes my cud. I only chew the grass a little bit, when I
first pull it from the meadow. I swallow it down into my first
stomach, and, when I have more time, I bring the cud of grass
up into my mouth and chew it as long as I please, so it will be
good for me to put into my last stomach."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily in surprise. "So
you have two stomachs and only one set of teeth."</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the cow, "but what is worrying me now is to
know whether I lost my cud of grass in the meadow, after I had
chewed on it a while, or whether it slipped down into my last
stomach before it was time."</p>

<p>"What will happen if it did?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll have indigestion," the cow lady answered.
"And that will make my milk bad and sour. Oh, dear! I wish
I knew where my cud was!"</p>

<p>"How did you come to lose it&mdash;or miss it?" asked the bunny.</p>

<p>"Why, I was watching Bully and Bawly No-Tail, the two
frog boys, hopping down by the brook," the cow lady said.
"They were playing leap-toad, you know&mdash;or, perhaps, it was
leap-frog; and Bully made such a funny jump over Bawly's
back that I laughed right out loud. I was chewing my cud at
the time, and when I stopped laughing I missed it. Now
whether I swallowed it, or whether it dropped in the brook, I
don't know. Isn't that dreadful?"</p>

<p>"Can't you tell by the way you feel&mdash;inside, you know,"
asked the bunny, "what became of your cud?"</p>

<p>"Not for some little time," answered the cow lady, "and then
it will be too late. Oh, if only I could find my cud somewhere
in this meadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
I'd know I hadn't swallowed it, and I'd be all
right."</p>

<p>"I know just how you feel," said Uncle Wiggily. "Once,
when Susie Littletail, the rabbit, was a tiny baby, her mother
gave her a big cake spoon to play with. She went out of the
room, leaving Susie to play with the spoon, and when she came
back it was gone."</p>

<p>"What was gone?" asked the cow lady, "Susie or the spoon?"</p>

<p>"The spoon," answered the bunny gentleman. "And as
Susie was too little to talk, and tell where it was, her mother
didn't know whether she had hidden, or dropped the spoon
somewhere, or whether she had swallowed it."</p>

<p>"Just fancy!" mooed the cow. "How exciting! But what
happened?"</p>

<p>"Why, finally," said Uncle Wiggily, "after I had hopped
over to help, we found the spoon behind the piano where Susie
had thrown it. Then we knew she hadn't swallowed it."</p>

<p>"And if I could find my cud I'd know I hadn't swallowed
<i>that</i>," sadly said the cow lady.</p>

<p>"I'll help you look," offered Uncle Wiggily. "I'm a pretty
good hopper, and I'll hop around the meadow and look for your
cud of half-chewed grass."</p>

<p>The bunny set down his molasses jug and began looking all
over the meadow for the cud. And the cow helped, but she
could not move very fast. Besides, she was worried and nervous.</p>

<p>"Here it is! I've found it!" suddenly called Uncle Wiggily,
and there on the grass, near the brook where the frog boys had
been leaping, was the cow lady's cud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
"Oh, how glad I am to get it back!" she mooed as she began
to chew it again. "Now my milk will be nice and sweet. You
have done me a great favor, Uncle Wiggily. I hope I may do
you the same some day."</p>

<p>"Pray do not mention it," said the bunny politely, as he
hopped on with his molasses jug. "It was just a little adventure
for me."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily hopped on to the store, had the jug filled
with molasses and then went to his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>"Well, you were gone a long time," said Nurse Jane. "I have
been waiting to make the ginger cake."</p>

<p>"I had to help a cow lady find her lost cud," said the bunny.</p>

<p>"Oh, Wiggy! What next!" laughed Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.
"Helping cow ladies! Oh! Oh!"</p>

<p>"That's all right," the bunny said. "Perhaps some day a
cow lady may help us."</p>

<p>"I don't see how she can," spoke Nurse Jane, as she started
to make the cake. But pretty soon she called to the bunny who
had gone to sit outside on a bench and warm his rheumatism
in the sun.</p>

<p>"Oh, Wiggy!" exclaimed Nurse Jane. "I can't get the cork
out of the molasses jug. It's in so tight! I can't pull it out, and
if I break it, and push it inside, then the molasses won't run
out. Oh, what a lot of trouble!"</p>

<p>"Let me try!" offered the bunny. But he could not get the
cork out of the molasses jug either, not even with his red, white
and blue striped rheumatism crutch.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll have to break the jug!" said the bunny at last.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't do that!" spoke a voice behind him, and, turning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Uncle Wiggily saw the cow lady. "I am on my way home to
be milked," she mooed, "and I saw you in trouble, so I came
over. What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"We can't get the cork out of the molasses jug," answered
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can," said Mrs. Cow. "Please let me try."</p>

<p>"We have a corkscrew somewhere," remarked Nurse Jane,
"but I can't find it."</p>

<p>"I shall not need it," went on the cow.</p>

<p>Then with one of her long, sharp horns she easily pried the
cork out of the molasses jug, breaking nothing and making it
very easy for Nurse Jane to pour out the sweet stuff for the
ginger cake.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Cow," said Uncle Wiggily, as the milk
lady animal went on her way.</p>

<p>"Pray don't mention it!" mooed the cow. "Now we are
even, as far as favors go!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily looked at Nurse Jane, and the muskrat lady
smiled at the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"You were right, Wiggly," spoke Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy. "I
never thought a cow could help anyone, but this shows how little
I know."</p>

<p>"That's all right!" laughed the bunny. "Mistakes will happen!"</p>

<p>So once again everything came out all right for the bunny
gentleman, you see, and if the pussy cat doesn't make a popcorn
ball out of snow, for the puppy dog to play bean bag with,
you shall next hear about Uncle Wiggily and the camping
boys.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CAMPING BOYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily! What you think?" cried Baby Bunty
one day, as she hopped up to the rabbit gentleman, who was
pulling the weeds out of his carrot garden.</p>

<p>"What I think, Baby Bunty?" repeated Mr. Longears, smiling
down one side of his pink, twinkling nose. "Well, I think
lots of things, my little rabbit girl. But if you think I'm going
to play <i>tag</i> with you this morning you are wrong. I haven't
time!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want you to play tag!" exclaimed Baby Bunty,
though she was such a lively little tyke that she nearly always
wanted Uncle Wiggily to play a game of some sort. "But
there's something over in the woods," she went on. "What you
think it is?" and she was quite excited.</p>

<p>"Something over in the woods, Baby Bunty?" asked Uncle
Wiggily, as he looked at one of his carrots to see if the point
needed sharpening; but it didn't, I'm glad to say. "Well,
what's in the woods, Baby Bunty; the Fox, the Skeezicks or the
Pipsisewah?"</p>

<p>"Neither one, Uncle Wiggily," answered the little rabbit
girl. "But there's a lot of those funny animals you call 'boys,'
and they're making a snow house, and maybe they'll try to catch
you, or me or Nurse Jane," and Baby Bunty looked quite worried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
"A <i>snow</i> house this time of year! Tut! Tut! Nonsense!"
laughed Uncle Wiggily. "This is summer and there isn't any
snow with which to make houses."</p>

<p>"Well, these boys, in the woods, are making a <i>white</i> house,
anyhow, Uncle Wiggily," spoke the little rabbit girl, who once
had lived in a hollow stump, before she came to visit the bunny
gentleman. "It's a white house, and there's a lot of boys, and
they're cutting down wood, and making a fire and boiling a
kettle of water and oh, they're doing lots of things! I thought
I'd better come and tell you."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Uncle Wiggily, straightening up to rest his
back, which ached from pulling the weeds out of his garden.
"Yes, perhaps it is a good thing you told me, Baby Bunty. I'll
go have a look at the white house the boys are putting up."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty hopped through the woods,
and soon they were near that side of the forest nearest the village
where real boys and girls lived. Through the green trees
gleamed something white, on which the sun shone as brightly
as it does at the seashore.</p>

<p>"There's the house," said Baby Bunty, pointing with her paw
off among the trees.</p>

<p>"Ho! That isn't exactly a <i>house</i>!" Uncle Wiggily told the
little rabbit girl. "That's a white tent, and those boys must
be camping there. Boys like to come to the woods to camp in
the summer. We'll hop a little closer and listen. Then we
can tell what they are doing."</p>

<p>"We mustn't let 'em see us!" whispered Baby Bunty. "Oh,
no!"</p>

<p>"Well, no, maybe not first along," Uncle Wiggily agreed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
"But nearly all boys, especially the kind that go camping, are
fond of animals, and will not hurt them. We will see what sort
of boys these are, Baby Bunty."</p>

<p>So the bunny gentleman and the little rabbit girl hid behind
the bushes and watched the camping boys, for that is what they
were. They had come to spend a few weeks in the woods,
living in a white tent which, at first, Baby Bunty thought was
a snow house.</p>

<p>The boys had just come to camp, and the tent had been up
only a little while. But already the lads had started a campfire;
and they had hung a Gypsy kettle over the blaze, and were
cooking soup.</p>

<p>"Get some more water, somebody!" called one boy.</p>

<p>"And I'm not going to cut any more wood!" exclaimed another.
"I've been cutting wood ever since we got here!"</p>

<p>"We'll take turns!" spoke a third boy.</p>

<p>"Look out! That soup's boiling over!" shouted a fourth.</p>

<p>"They're regular boys all right!" chuckled Uncle Wiggily,
as he crouched under a bush with Baby Bunty. "They're so
excited at coming to camp they hardly know what they're
doing."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty could hear and understand
what the boys said, though they themselves could not speak to
the camping chaps. For a time the two rabbits watched the
little lads, who were trying to get a meal. They made many
mistakes, of course, such as getting the salt mixed up with the
sugar, and they left the bread out of its tin box so it dried, for
they had never been camping before.</p>

<p>"But they'll soon learn," said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
"I hope they won't chase us, and throw stones at us," Baby
Bunty remarked, as she and Mr. Longears hopped away.</p>

<p>"I think they are good boys," spoke the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>And the camping boys were. When they had finished eating
they scattered crumbs so the birds could pick them up. Larger
pieces of left-over food were placed on a flat stump where the
squirrels and chipmunks could get them.</p>

<p>Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the two boy squirrels, saw some
of this food as they were coming through the woods. The camping
boys were away just then, so the squirrel chaps had no fear
of going close to the white tent-house. Johnnie found a piece
of bread and butter, and Billie picked up half a ginger snap.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 625px;">
<img src="images/p170_625.jpg" width="625" height="442" alt="Johnnie found a piece of bread and butter." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
"That shows the camping boys are kind to animals," said
Uncle Wiggily, when Johnnie and Billie told him what they
had found. "I hope I may get a chance to do these lads a
favor."</p>

<p>And Uncle Wiggily had this chance sooner than he expected.</p>

<p>For about a week the weather was most lovely for camping.
The sun shone every day, the wind blew just enough to send
the sailboat spinning about the lake and there wasn't a drop
of rain.</p>

<p>It is rain which soaks most of the fun out of camping, just
as rain takes away your fun at home. And these boys, never
having camped in a tent before, gave no thought to storms.</p>

<p>One afternoon it began to rain. Uncle Wiggily, in his hollow
stump bungalow, where he was reading the cabbage-leaf
paper, heard the pitter-patter of the drops on the window, and
looked up.</p>

<p>"Where is Baby Bunty, Nurse Jane?" asked the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"Why, she hasn't come back from the store yet," answered
the muskrat lady housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Did she take an umbrella?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"No," replied Nurse Jane, "she did not."</p>

<p>"Then she'll get soaking wet!" exclaimed Mr. Longears.
"I'll go after her with a toadstool."</p>

<p>You know in Woodland, near the Orange Ice Mountain,
where Uncle Wiggily lived, toadstools were often used for umbrellas.
Of course, some of the animal folk had regular umbrellas,
but when they were in a hurry they could break off a big
toadstool, or mushroom, and use that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
So Uncle Wiggily hopped out of his hollow stump bungalow,
and, growing near his front gate, he found a big toadstool.
Picking this, he held it over his head and hurried along through
the rain to meet Baby Bunty, who had gone to the three and five cent
store for Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily had to hop almost to the place where the tent
of the camping boys stood before he met the little rabbit girl,
half drenched.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily! You ought to see!" cried Baby Bunty.
"There is so much water around the tent that those nice boys
will be washed away, I guess!"</p>

<p>"Water around their tent?" repeated the bunny gentleman.
"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Baby Bunty. "The rain is coming down so hard
that it is running like a little brook around the tent. The boys
are inside, and I heard them saying that the water would soon
come up over the cots and they wouldn't have any dry place to
sleep to-night!"</p>

<p>"Silly boys!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, holding the toadstool
umbrella over Baby Bunty. "They didn't know enough
to dig a ditch around the outside of their tent to let the rain
water run off. All campers do that, but as this is the first time
these boys came to the woods I suppose they didn't know about
it. Always dig a ditch, or trench, in the earth around your
tent when you go camping, Baby Bunty."</p>

<p>"I will," promised the little rabbit girl, real serious like.</p>

<p>"But that isn't going to help the boys now," went on Uncle
Wiggily. "I think I shall have to take a paw in this. They are
good boys, and are kind to animals. I must do them a favor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
"But how can you?" asked Baby Bunty.</p>

<p>"Why, I, being a rabbit, am one of the best diggers in the
world," went on Mr. Longears. "Still, I will need help to dig
a ditch around the tent, as it is rather large. Hop home, Baby
Bunty, and tell Sammie Littletail, Toodle and Noodle Flat-Tail,
the beaver boys, and Grandpa Whackum, the old beaver
gentleman, to please come here. With their help I can dig the
ditch."</p>

<p>So Baby Bunty, taking the toadstool umbrella, hopped away,
and Uncle Wiggily, to await her return, hid under a thick-branched
pine tree which kept off most of the rain. The drops
pelted down, and around the tent of the camping boys was almost
a flood. Night was coming on, too, and before morning
the water would rise up so high that it would wet the feet of the
boys in their beds.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, just about dusk, when it was still raining hard,
along came Sammie Littletail, the rabbit boy, Toodle and
Noodle the beavers, with their broad, flat tails, and Grandpa
Whackum, the oldest beaver of them all. Beavers just love to
work in the water and they can dig dirt canals better than most
boys.</p>

<p>"Lively now, my friends!" called Uncle Wiggily, coming
out from under the pine tree. "We'll dig a ditch around the
tent for the kind boys. They won't see us, as they are inside,
and probably will not come out in the train."</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily, Sammie and the beavers began work.
Quickly and silently they dug and dug and dug in the soft
earth, piling the dirt to one side, and making a trench so that
the rain water could run off into the brook. And soon the little
pond <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>that had formed around the tent of the camping boys had
drained away.</p>

<p>"Now they will have no more trouble," said Uncle Wiggily
as he and his friends, all wet and muddy, finished the trench.
"We can go home."</p>

<p>Home they went, through the rain, to get something to eat
and dry out. And in the morning, though it still rained, no
water rose inside the boys' tent. And none came through the
roof, for that was like an umbrella, the canvas cloth being
stretched over the ridge-pole.</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" cried one boy, coming to the flap of the tent, as
the front of the canvas house is called. "Someone has dug a
ditch around our camp, and now we'll keep dry!"</p>

<p>"Why, it's a regular little canal!" exclaimed a second boy.
"It wasn't there yesterday!"</p>

<p>"Who did it?" asked the other lads.</p>

<p>But none of them knew, and I hope you will not tell them,
for I want to keep it a secret.</p>

<p>And when the rain stopped, the ground around the tent dried
out very quickly because the proper ditch had been dug around
it. And the camping boys put out on the flat stump many good
things for the animal folk to eat. And the next time those boys
went camping they knew enough to make a trench around their
tent.</p>

<p>Now let me see; what shall we have next? Well, I think I
shall tell you the story of Uncle Wiggily and the birthday cake&mdash;that
is, I will if the snow-shovel doesn't make the coal-scuttle
sneeze when they are playing tag down under the cellar steps.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVI" id="XXVI">STORY XXVI</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BIRTHDAY CAKE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"To-morrow is my birthday! To-morrow is my birthday!
And I'm going to have a cake with ten candles on!"</p>

<p>A little girl sang this over and over as she danced around the
house one morning.</p>

<p>"Ten candles! And they'll be lighted, and I can blow them
out and cut the cake and pass it around; can't I, Mother?" asked
the little girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," Mother answered. "But if you are going to
have a birthday cake you must go to the store and get me some
flour, sugar and eggs. I did not know I needed them, but I do,
if you are to have a cake."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I want a cake!" said the little girl. "It
wouldn't be at all like a birthday without a cake! And ten
candles on top, all lighted! Last year I only had nine candles.
But now I can have ten! Ten candles! Ten candles on my
birthday cake!" sang the happy little girl again and again.
"Ten candles! Ten candles!"</p>

<p>"You had better go to the store, instead of singing so much!"
laughed her mother. "Sing on your way, if you like. But don't
forget the flour, sugar and eggs."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
"I'll get them," said the little girl, and off she started, taking
a short cut through the woods to reach the store more quickly.</p>

<p>These woods were the same ones in which Uncle Wiggily had
built his hollow stump bungalow, and about the same time the
little girl started off to get the things for her birthday cake the
bunny rabbit gentleman stood on his front porch.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
his muskrat lady housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Oh, just to hop through the forest, to look for an adventure,"
answered Mr. Longears. "I haven't had one since I helped dig
the rain-trench about the tent of the camping boys."</p>

<p>"I should think that would be enough to last a long time,"
spoke Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I need a new adventure every day!" laughed the
bunny, and over the fields and through the woods he hopped.</p>

<p>Now Uncle Wiggily had not gone very far before, all of a
sudden, he stepped into a trap. It was a spring trap, set in the
woods by some hunter who had covered it with dried leaves so
it could not easily be seen. That's the way hunters fool the wild
animals.</p>

<p>And, not seeing the trap, Uncle Wiggily hopped right into it.</p>

<p>"Snap!" went the jaws of the trap together, catching the poor
bunny gentleman fast by one hind leg.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" cried Mr. Longears. "I'm caught! But it is fortunate
that it is a smooth-jawed trap, and not the kind with
sharp teeth. If I could only get my leg loose I'd be all right;
except that my paw might be lame and stiff for a few days. I
must try to get out!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily tried to pull his paw from the trap, but it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of no use. The spring held the jaws too tightly together. The
bunny gentleman twinkled his pink nose as hard as he could,
and he even tried to pry apart the trap jaws with his red, white
and blue striped rheumatism crutch. But he couldn't.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" though Uncle Wiggily. "I must call for help.
Perhaps Neddie Stubtail, the strong boy bear, will hear me. He
could easily spring open this trap and set me free."</p>

<p>So the bunny gentleman called as loudly as he could:</p>

<p>"Help! Help!"</p>

<p>Of course he talked animal talk, and for this reason the little
girl, who was going to have a birthday cake, with ten candles on
it, did not know what Uncle Wiggily was saying. She heard
him making a noise, though, for she passed the place where the
bunny was caught in the trap, soon after the accident happened.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that funny noise is?" said the little girl, as
Uncle Wiggily again called for help. "It sounds like some animal.
I wish I understood animal talk!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily wished, with all his heart, that the little girl
could hear what he was saying, for he was calling for help. The
bunny understood girl-talk, and he knew what this girl was
saying, for she spoke her thoughts out loud.</p>

<p>"But she doesn't know what I want!" said poor Uncle Wiggily
to himself. "She is sure to be good and kind, as all girls
are, and if I could only get her to come over this way she might
take me out of the trap."</p>

<p>The little girl, on her way home from the store, had come to
a stop not far from Uncle Wiggily, but she could not see him
because he was behind a bush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
"I must make some kind of a noise that she will hear," thought
the bunny. Then he thrashed around in the bushes with his
crutch, rattling the dried leaves and the green bushes, and the
little girl heard this noise.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe a bird is caught in a big cobweb!" said the little
girl. "I'll get it loose&mdash;I love the birds!"</p>

<p>Putting down her bundle of flour, sugar and eggs on a flat
stump, she made her way through the bushes until she saw where
Uncle Wiggily was caught in the trap.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/p178_650.jpg" width="650" height="474" alt="I wish you would come to my birthday party!" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, what a funny rabbit!" cried the little girl as she looked
at the bunny gentleman all dressed, as he always was when he
went to look for an adventure. "He looks just like a picture on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>an Easter card!" laughed the little girl. "I wish I had him at
my party!"</p>

<p>"Well, I wish she'd take this trap off my paw!" thought Uncle
Wiggily, though of course he could say nothing, however much
he could hear.</p>

<p>Then the little girl looked down among the leaves and saw
where the trap pinched Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor bunny rabbit!" she cried. "I'll set you loose."</p>

<p>Very gently she pressed her foot on the spring of the trap, to
open it. And when the jaws were opened Uncle Wiggily could
lift out his paw, which he did. He hopped a little way over the
dried leaves, limping a bit, for the pinching trap had pained
him. Then, coming to a stop on a smooth, grassy place, the
bunny leaned on his red, white and blue striped rheumatism
crutch and, taking off his tall silk hat, he made a low and polite
bow to the little girl.</p>

<p>"Thank you for having done me a great favor!" said Uncle
Wiggily in animal talk. "I wish I could do one for you!"</p>

<p>But of course the little girl could not understand this bunny
language, so she only laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, what a dear, funny bunny! With a tall hat and everything!
I wish you would come to my birthday party! I'm going
to have a cake with ten lighted candles on!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'd like to come, but it is out of the question,"
answered Uncle Wiggily in his own talk. Then, with another
low and polite bow, he hopped away.</p>

<p>The little girl picked up the things she had bought at the store
and went home.</p>

<p>"You'll never guess what I saw in the woods," she told her
mother. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
"A bunny rabbit, all dressed in a black coat and red
trousers, was caught in a trap, and I set him free!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" laughed Mother. "Whoever heard of a rabbit
like that? You are so excited about your birthday cake that
you were dreaming, I think!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mother! I didn't dream!" said the little girl.
"Really I didn't!"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind. Now we'll make your birthday cake,"
answered Mother.</p>

<p>The birthday cake was mixed and baked in the oven, and on
top was spread pink frosting.</p>

<p>"We'll put the candles on to-morrow, when you have your
party," Mother told the little girl.</p>

<p>To-morrow came, after a night in which Cora Janet, which
was the little girl's name, had dreamed about riding in an airship,
with a bunny gentleman dressed up like a soldier. In the
afternoon many boys and girls came to Cora Janet's birthday
party.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely everything is!" exclaimed a little boy, when
he was given his second dish of ice cream.</p>

<p>"Wait until you see my birthday cake with ten candles on!"
whispered Cora Janet.</p>

<p>When it was almost time to bring on the lighted cake, Mother
called Cora Janet out into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Did you get the candles, Cora?" Mother asked.</p>

<p>"Why, no!" the little girl answered. "I&mdash;I thought we had
candles!"</p>

<p>"And I thought I told you to get them," Mother went on.
"There isn't one in the house! I've looked everywhere. Never
mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
perhaps I can borrow some next door. Go back to your
friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do hope you can get candles!" sighed Cora Janet. "A
birthday cake without candles will hardly be right!"</p>

<p>Mother asked the lady who lived next door, on one side, if
she had any candles.</p>

<p>"Not a one, I'm sorry to say," was the answer.</p>

<p>Then Mother asked the lady on the other side.</p>

<p>"Oh, I never use candles," this lady replied, coming out on
her back stoop to talk over the fence to Cora Janet's mother.
"I'm so sorry!"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess they'll have to eat the cake without any birthday
candles on," said Mother. "Cora Janet will be so disappointed,
too, as she is such an imaginative child! Just fancy,
Mrs. Blake, she came home yesterday, and told about helping
out of a trap an old rabbit gentleman, with a tall silk hat!"</p>

<p>"The idea! She must have dreamed it!" said Mrs. Blake.</p>

<p>"No, she didn't dream it! That really happened!" said
Uncle Wiggily to himself, who was just then hopping through
the fields back of the house where Cora Janet lived. "So this is
her home, is it?" went on the bunny gentleman to himself.
"And she hasn't any candles for her birthday cake! Too bad!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily had hopped along just in time to hear Cora
Janet's mother asking for candles of the neighbors.</p>

<p>"It's so late that all the stores are closed," went on Mrs.
Blake, "or I'd go get some candles for Cora."</p>

<p>"Never mind," spoke Mother. "She will have to bear her
disappointment as best she can."</p>

<p>"No! That must not be!" said Uncle Wiggily to himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
"I cannot give her real candles, but I can leave on her steps some
slivers of the pine tree. They have in them pitch, tar and resin
and will burn almost like candles. When I was a rabbit boy
I often lighted these pine-tree candles."</p>

<p>Not far away were the woods, and, hopping across the field
in the dusk of the evening, Uncle Wiggily, with his sharp teeth,
soon gnawed off some pine-knot splinters from one of the trees.
In olden times, when there were no electric or kerosene lamps,
children used to study their lessons in front of the fireplaces, by
these pine knots.</p>

<p>"These will do for birthday-cake candles," whispered Uncle
Wiggily, as he hopped back to Cora Janet's house with a paw
full of the pine knots. He put them on the stoop, and then, with
his hind paws, he kicked some gravel from the front walk up
against the dining-room windows.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Cora Janet, as she heard the noise.</p>

<p>"Some bad boys playing tick-tack," said one of the girls at the
party. "They're playing tricks because they weren't asked."</p>

<p>"I'll see who it is," spoke Mother.</p>

<p>She went out on the porch. There she saw the pile of pine
knot slivers. Having lived in the country when she was a girl,
Mother knew that these bits of wood could be used for candles.</p>

<p>"Oh, now I can make the birthday cake blaze most brightly!"
exclaimed Mother. Into the house she hurried. She stuck ten
pine-knot slivers on the cake, for Uncle Wiggily had left a full
dozen, not knowing exactly how old Cora Janet was. Then,
when the pine knots were lighted, Mother carried the cake into
the room where the boys and girls were wishing Cora Janet many
happy returns for her birthday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
"Oh, where did you get the candles?" asked Cora.</p>

<p>"I guess the rabbit you dreamed you saw must have left
them," answered Mother, in fun, of course, for she never
thought that really could happen.</p>

<p>"Dream-candles or not, they are lovely!" murmured the little
girl.</p>

<p>And everyone at the party said the same thing.</p>

<p>They watched Cora Janet as, one by one, she blew out the
pine candles on her birthday cake. And when the last one flickered
away, the cake was cut amid the joyous laughter of the
boys and girls.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad I could do her a favor," said the bunny rabbit
to himself, as hidden under the lilac bush, he heard and
saw all that went on. "I shall always love Cora Janet!"</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>So if the needle doesn't wink its eye when it sits on the sewing-machine
to read the paper of pins, I'll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and the New Year's horn.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVII" id="XXVII">STORY XXVII</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE NEW YEAR'S HORN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Christmas had come and gone, and the next holiday for the
boys and girls who lived in the village outside of Uncle Wiggily's
forest was to be New Year's Day. I call it Uncle Wiggily's
forest for on one edge of it the bunny rabbit gentleman
had built himself a hollow stump bungalow. There he lived
with Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, his muskrat lady housekeeper.</p>

<p>On the farther side of the wood was the village where many
real boys and girls had their homes. To them, as I say, Christmas
had come and gone, bringing to most of them presents which
they liked very much.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have a lot of fun on New Year's," said one boy
to another as they were coasting on the hill the last day of the old
year.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked the other boy.</p>

<p>"I'm going to blow the Old Year out and the New Year in,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"Gracious me sakes alive!" thought Uncle Wiggily Longears,
the bunny rabbit gentleman, who happened to be resting
under a bush near where the boys were coasting down hill. "I
hope he doesn't blow the Old Year so far away that the New
Year will be afraid to come in," said Mr. Longears to himself.
Then he listened again, for the boys were talking further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
"How you going to blow?" one lad wanted to know.</p>

<p>"With my Christmas horn," was the answer. "I got a dandy
horn for Christmas. To-night is New Year's eve. My father
said I could stay up late. At twelve o'clock the Old Year goes
away and the New Year comes, and we're going to have a party
at our house, and I'm going to blow my horn like anything!"</p>

<p>"So'm I," said several other boys.</p>

<p>"Where does the Old Year go when you blow it away?"
asked a lad who had red hair and freckles.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," answered the boy who had first talked
of his Christmas horn. "It just goes&mdash;that's all! It disappears
same as the hole in a doughnut when you eat it."</p>

<p>"You don't eat the <i>hole</i>!" declared another boy.</p>

<p>"Well, you eat all around it," was the answer, "and then
there isn't any hole any more. It's the same with the Old Year.
After twelve o'clock on December 31 there isn't any Old Year
any more. It's January the first, and it's the New Year. I'm
going to blow my horn loud! All the fellows are!"</p>

<p>"We will, too!" cried the rest of the boys.</p>

<p>But one lad, who had a clumsy, home-made sled on the hill,
did not say he was going to blow the New Year in. He turned
away as the other lads talked of their coming fun. Someone
asked him:</p>

<p>"Are you going to watch the Old Year out, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"No, I guess not," was the answer. "I'm going to sleep."</p>

<p>"The noise will wake you up," someone suggested.</p>

<p>"Well, then I'll go to sleep again," was the answer.</p>

<p>"I guess the reason Jimmy won't blow the Old Year out and
the New Year in is because he hasn't any horn," said a boy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
a fine new blue sled. "He didn't get hardly anything for
Christmas."</p>

<p>"That's too bad!" softly spoke the lad who had first mentioned
about blowing in the New Year. "Maybe I can find an
old horn at my house, and I'll take it to him. If I could find
two I'd take another to his sister. But I don't believe I can."</p>

<p>"Oh, won't we have fun, blowing the New Year in?" cried
the boys, as they walked to the top of the hill so they might
coast down. But Jimmy did not join in the joyous shout. He
was a poor boy, and, as the others had said, he had not found
much in his stocking at Christmas. Certainly there was no bright
tooting horn!</p>

<p>"This is too bad!" thought Uncle Wiggily, as he hopped back
to his hollow stump bungalow, after the coasting boys were out
of the way so they would not see him. "I wonder how I could
get a New Year's horn for that poor boy?"</p>

<p>The bunny gentleman was wondering about this, but he could
not seem to think of any plan, when, as he was about to hop up
his bungalow steps, he saw Billie Wagtail, the goat boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" bleated Billie. "See my new horns!"</p>

<p>"Your new horns!" exclaimed Mr. Longears, turning toward
the goat chap. "Are you going to blow the New Year in, also?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not with these horns," went on Billie. "I mean,
see the new horns on my head. I was ill, you know, and my old
horns dropped off, and now I have these new ones," and he shook
his head, on which were two long, curving sharp horns. "I'm
going to blow the New Year in," bleated the boy goat, "but not
on my head horns; on my Christmas tin horn."</p>

<p>"That's more than one boy whom I know about is going to
do,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
said Uncle Wiggily a little sadly. Then the bunny gentleman
had a sudden thought. "Do you s'pose, Billie," he asked
the goat boy, "that your old horns could be made into blowing
ones for New Year's?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I guess so," Billie answered. "But you'd have to
saw off one end to make a place to blow in. My horns are partly
hollow and if you blew in the little end, after making a hole
there, the noise would come out the other end."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/p187_650.jpg" width="650" height="459" alt="Oh, Uncle Wiggily! bleated Billy. See my new horns!" />
</div>

<p>"Then I know what I can do!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily.
"Get me your old horns, Billie boy, and I'll fix them up for New
Year's blowing. I know how to do it!"</p>

<p>The Wagtail goat chap gave the bunny gentleman the old
horns. Uncle Wiggily took them into his bungalow, and he and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Nurse Jane washed them clean and polished them. Then, with
her sharp teeth, the muskrat lady gnawed a little off the small
end of each horn, so they could be blown through.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily made two wooden whistles and fastened one
in the small end of each horn.</p>

<p>"Now I'll try it, Janie," he said to Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily blew into the small end of one horn. Out of
the other end came a sweet tooting sound.</p>

<p>"Hurray!" cried the bunny gentleman. "These will be just
right for New Year's! I'll take one to the poor boy and one to
his sister. Then they can celebrate with their friends who have
regular tin horns."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you to be so thoughtful," said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"And it was kind of you to help me make the New Year's
horns from Billie's old ones," spoke Uncle Wiggily, as he
skipped along, for it was getting dark and soon the Old Year
would go away&mdash;like the hole in the doughnut&mdash;and the New
Year would come, to bring with it Fourth of July, birthdays
and Christmas.</p>

<p>Up the steps of the house of the poor boy and girl who had
no New Year's horns to blow hopped Uncle Wiggily. No one
saw him in the dusk. He placed the horns on the doormat,
tapped three times with his red, white and blue striped rheumatism
crutch on the porch, and then hopped away.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked the girl of the boy.</p>

<p>"I'll go see," he answered.</p>

<p>The boy opened the door and saw, in the light of the moon,
which just then came from behind a cloud, the two goat horns
made into New Year's "tooters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
"Oh, hurray!" shouted the boy, as he blew on one of the horns.
"Now we can send the Old Year on its way and tell the New
Year how glad we are to see him. Hurray!"</p>

<p>"And I can blow, too!" laughed the girl. "Hurray!"</p>

<p>Her brother gave her the other horn, and when twelve
o'clock midnight came, the children blew on the tooters as loudly
as they could. So did all the other boys and girls in the village;
and the animal boys and girls in their nest-houses and burrows
also blew on horns and wooden whistles to welcome the New
Year.</p>

<p>All over the land the bells rang and horns were blown.
Uncle Wiggily heard them in his hollow stump bungalow, and
so did Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"Happy New Year!" wished the muskrat lady.</p>

<p>"Happy New Year!" echoed the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>The boy and girl, blowing Billie Wagtail's old horns, danced
around their father and mother, wishing them a Happy New
Year also.</p>

<p>"Where did you get the horns?" asked Mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess Santa Claus dropped them, on his way back to
the North Pole," answered the boy.</p>

<p>But we know better than that; don't we?</p>

<p>So, after all, everything came out right, and the boy and girl
were very happy with their queer New Year's horns.</p>

<p>But if the Jumping Jack doesn't tickle the lollypop with the
sharp end of the ice-cream cone, and make it fall off the stick,

I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily's Thanksgiving.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVIII" id="XXVIII">STORY XXVIII</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY'S THANKSGIVING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There came, one afternoon, a knock at the door of the hollow
stump bungalow where Uncle Wiggily Longears lived.</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose that can be the Fuzzy Fox or the Woozie
Wolf?" anxiously asked Nurse Jane, the muskrat lady housekeeper.</p>

<p>"No," answered the bunny gentleman. "They would not
dare come boldly up to my bungalow, in broad daylight, though
if it were night they might come sneaking along, trying to nibble
my ears. I suppose this may be Sammie or Susie Littletail, or
Johnnie or Billie Bushytail. I'll let them in."</p>

<p>But when Uncle Wiggily opened the door, in came rushing a
great big turkey gobbler gentleman. In his bill he carried a
basket in which set a dish filled with something red.</p>

<p>"I have it, Uncle Wiggily! I have it!" exclaimed the turkey.
"I picked it up and ran away with it! Now they can't have any
Thanksgiving and I'll be safe! Shut the door!" he gobbled,
and setting the basket on the floor he scuttled behind a chair,
while Nurse Jane and Uncle Wiggily were so surprised they
hardly knew what to do.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> in the world have you brought with you, Mr. Gobble
Obble?" asked the bunny gentleman. Gobble Obble was the
turkey's name.</p>

<p>"The <i>cranberry sauce</i>," was the answer. "At our house, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
I have been living, they are making a great fuss over Thanksgiving,
which will happen in a few days. They have been feeding
me up to fatten me, and every day the Man would come out
and look at me; though I didn't know what for until I heard the
children talking about it."</p>

<p>"Talking about what?" Nurse Jane wanted to know.</p>

<p>"<i>Thanksgiving</i>," gobbled the turkey. "This morning I heard
the cook say: 'That gobbler is fat enough to roast, now. I think
I'll make the cranberry sauce. It will be Thanksgiving soon!'"</p>

<p>"Then," went on the turkey, "I knew why they had been feeding
me things to make me fat! You can't imagine how I felt!
Well, the cook made the cranberry sauce. She put it in a dish
and set it out on the back steps to cool. I watched my chance,
picked it up and ran over here. There's the cranberry sauce!"
and Mr. Gobble Obble pointed to it with one wing.</p>

<p>"But why in the world did you bring away the cranberry
sauce? What good is that going to do you?" asked Uncle Wiggily,
very much puzzled by the turkey's queer talk and actions.</p>

<p>"Listen," gobbled the turkey. "I heard one of the children
say that Thanksgiving wouldn't be Thanksgiving without <i>turkey
and cranberry sauce</i>! Then, thinks I to myself, if I run
away, and take the cranberry sauce with me, there will be no
Thanksgiving, and many poor turkeys will be glad of it."</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" laughed Uncle Wiggily, chuckling so hard
that his pink nose twinkled like a lightning bug on Fourth of
July.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mr. Gobble Obble. "Won't you
be good enough to hide me and the cranberry sauce until after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Thanksgiving? Then I'll be safe."</p>

<p>"Of course you may stay here," said the bunny gentleman.
"But the idea of thinking you can stop Thanksgiving by hiding
yourself, or the cranberry sauce!"</p>

<p>"Can't I?" asked Mr. Gobble Obble, doubtful-like.</p>

<p>"Of course you can't!" exclaimed Mr. Longears. "Why,
Thanksgiving doesn't mean just feasting on turkey, ice cream
and cranberries!"</p>

<p>"It does at the house I ran away from," said Mr. Gobble
Obble.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I suppose it does at many other houses," went on
the bunny gentleman. "But Thanksgiving is really a time in
which to be thankful for the things one has had to eat all the
year&mdash;for that, and other blessings. The Pilgrim Fathers, who
came over to live among the Indians, were thankful for even a
little parched corn."</p>

<p>"What are Indians?" asked the turkey, who had never studied
history.</p>

<p>"Wild men, who wore feathers such as yours," said Nurse
Jane. "They are Indians."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about the Indians some day," promised Uncle
Wiggily. "Now we must talk more about Thanksgiving."</p>

<p>"I don't like to talk about it," sighed Mr. Gobble Obble. "It
isn't a happy thing for me even to think about, much less talk
about!"</p>

<p>"But you shouldn't have run away with the cranberry sauce,"
went on the bunny gentleman. "I'm afraid I shall have to ask
you to take it back."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;I will," promised Mr. Gobble Obble. "But I'll
go after dark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
so the cook won't see me. Then I'll come here
again and stay with you and Nurse Jane."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," invited the bunny. "Spend Thanksgiving with
us."</p>

<p>So when it grew dark Mr. Gobble Obble picked up the basket
of cranberry sauce in his bill, and went over the fields and
through the woods to the village, where lived the real boys and
girls and their fathers and mothers. Softly and silently, like the
shadow of a feathered Indian, the turkey made his way to the
back stoop. There he set down the cranberry sauce and
scuttled over to Uncle Wiggily's hollow stump bungalow again.</p>

<p>Days and nights came and went, and then it was Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"Very lucky am I to live to see this day," gobbled the turkey
as he ate breakfast with Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane. "If
I hadn't run away with the cranberry sauce I'd be roasting in
the oven now!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you aren't," spoke the bunny. "Though of
course it wasn't right for you to take the cranberry sauce."</p>

<p>"They'll have that for Thanksgiving, anyhow," remarked
Nurse Jane. "But now, Wiggy," she went on, "if I get the
baskets ready, will you start out with them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy," answered the bunny gentleman,
twinkling his pink nose.</p>

<p>"What baskets are you speaking of?" asked Mr. Gobble
Obble, as he saw the muskrat lady putting carrot cakes, turnip
flopovers and lettuce sandwiches up in little bundles.</p>

<p>"These are for the poor folk of animal land," answered Uncle
Wiggily. "Each year, at Thanksgiving, Nurse Jane puts up a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
good dinner for them, and I take the baskets around in my automobile."</p>

<p>"How nice!" gobbled the turkey. "May I help? I'm so
thankful for not being in the oven, that I'd like to make some
one else thankful too, if I could."</p>

<p>"That's the idea!" cried the bunny. "Yes, come along, Mr.
Gobble Obble!"</p>

<p>Soon the bunny gentleman had filled his automobile with
baskets of good things packed by Nurse Jane. Over the fields
and through the woods rode Uncle Wiggily and the turkey gentleman,
and many a poor animal family was the happier for
Uncle Wiggily's visit.</p>

<p>And at last, when the final basket had been left, and Uncle
Wiggily and the turkey were on their way back to the bungalow,
out from behind a bush jumped the bad old Fuzzy Fox.</p>

<p>"I want to nibble Uncle Wiggily's ears for my Thanksgiving
dinner!" howled the Fox. "I want ears to nibble!"</p>

<p>"Well, you can't&mdash;not to-day!" laughed Uncle Wiggily, and
he made the auto go so fast that the Fox was left far, far behind.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" gobbled the turkey as they came within sight of the
stump bungalow. "This ride will give us a good appetite for
the Thanksgiving dinner."</p>

<p>"Indeed it will!" laughed the bunny.</p>

<p>But when they went inside, and met Nurse Jane, the muskrat
lady looked at them in such a queer way that Uncle Wiggily
asked:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Miss Fuzz Wuzz?" (He sometimes
called her that in fun.) "Has anything happened?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
"Yes, Uncle Wiggily, there has," sadly answered the muskrat
lady housekeeper. "I will not keep it from you!"</p>

<p>"Have&mdash;have they come after me?" asked the turkey in a
faint and far-off voice. "Have they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Nurse Jane. "But by mistake I packed up
everything in the house to eat in those Thanksgiving baskets,
Uncle Wiggily! I didn't save out a thing for ourselves, and
what to do about your Thanksgiving dinner I don't know! I'm
so sorry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut! Tut! Never mind," broke in Uncle Wiggily kindly.
"I dare say we shall find something to nibble on. A couple of
carrots will do me."</p>

<p>"Well, I have <i>those</i>," Nurse Jane said, "and a little corn."</p>

<p>"I love corn!" gobbled the turkey.</p>

<p>"I can eat it myself," the muskrat lady declared. "So if you
can put up with that for Thanksgiving, we'll eat!"</p>

<p>Then they sat down to the corn and carrots, and Uncle Wiggily
said:</p>

<p>"I'm thankful I could make the auto go so fast that we ran
away from the fox."</p>

<p>"So am I," agreed the gobbler. "And I'm thankful I'm here
sitting up to the dining table, instead of being nicely roasted on
<i>top</i> of it! And I'm thankful I could help you feed the poor
animal families."</p>

<p>"I'm thankful," spoke Nurse Jane, "because you two gentlemen
didn't scold and make a fuss when you found what a mistake
I'd made about the dinner."</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed Uncle Wiggily. "Then we are <i>all</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
thankful, and there could not possibly be a better Thanksgiving
than this!"</p>

<p>So they ate the corn and carrots and were very happy. And
if the jumping jack doesn't waggle his tail like a skyrocket and
knock over the milk bottles so they think they're roller skates
and slide down the back stoop, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the circus.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AT THE CIRCUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Jackie Bow Wow, the little puppy dog boy, came running
up to Uncle Wiggily one morning, so excited that he barked
three times and fell down twice, stubbing his toe over a lollypop
stick on the path.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" barked Jackie. "What you think?
There's pictures of elephants, and tigers and lions and camels!
There's a man putting up a big tent! There are red wagons and
golden chariots, and blue wagons and one that plays funny
tunes!"</p>

<p>"And there's a man with his face all painted red, white and
blue, just like your rheumatism crutch!" barked Peetie Bow
Wow, the other little puppy dog chap, as he ran up wagging his
tail. "And there's popcorn, peanuts and pink lemonade! Wuff!
Wuff!"</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" asked the bunny rabbit gentleman, as
he sat down on the steps of his hollow stump bungalow, while
the puppy dog boys caught their breaths, which had nearly run
away from them.</p>

<p>"It's a circus!" cried Jackie and Peetie just like twins, which
they almost were. "A real circus!"</p>

<p>"A circus!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "That's nice! Do
you mean it is the kind you animal boys sometimes get up;
where you charge two pins to get in and three pins for a seat?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
"Oh, no! It's a regular man-circus, that real boys and girls
go to see!" barked Jackie.</p>

<p>"It's like the kind we once ran away and joined, where we
learned to do jumping, to turn somersaults and other tricks,"
explained Peetie.</p>

<p>"Well, if it's that kind of a circus," spoke Uncle Wiggily,
"we needn't bother our heads about it. We animal folk can't
go to any real circus, you know!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's what we came to see you for!" whined Jackie.
"We want you to take us to the circus!"</p>

<p>"Take you to the circus!" cried Uncle Wiggily. "Why, the
very idea! How would an old rabbit gentleman and two funny
puppy dog boys look walking into a real circus? The men would
think we belonged to it, and had somehow gotten out of our
cages. They'd shut us up behind the iron bars, as the lions and
tigers are kept. Take you two to the circus! Oh, no! It
couldn't be thought of!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Jackie.</p>

<p>"We told the others that you'd take us," softly barked Peetie.</p>

<p>"What others?" Uncle Wiggily wanted to know, curious
like.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sammie and Susie Littletail, Johnnie and Billie Bushytail,
Lulu, Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble, and a lot of the
animal boys and girls," went on Peetie. "We were over on the
edge of the woods, looking at the circus men put up the tent and
the colored posters, and we all thought you'd take us."</p>

<p>"Baby Bunty will be so disappointed!" said Jackie.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily twinkled his pink nose serious like and
thoughtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
"Hum! Circus!" murmured the old rabbit gentleman. "So
Baby Bunty wants to go, does she? Well, she never saw a circus,
not even a make-believe one, such as you boys get up. Now
I don't care for a circus <i>myself</i>&mdash;I've seen too many of 'em. But
I'll go&mdash;just to take Baby Bunty!"</p>

<p>"And may we come?" asked Jackie, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, yes, I s'pose so!" slowly answered Mr. Longears.
"Nurse Jane will say I'm queer; but what matter? A circus
comes but once a year! Now run along, doggie boys. I'll have
to think up some way of getting all of you into the circus tent,
for we can't buy tickets and go in the regular way. The circus
men wouldn't understand."</p>

<p>Jackie and Peetie were so delighted that they turned somersaults
all the way across the field as they ran to tell the other
animal boys and girls. Meanwhile Uncle Wiggily hopped
along on his red, white and blue twinkling nose&mdash;&mdash;Oh, listen
to me, would you! I mean his rheumatism crutch. I guess I'm
getting excited about the circus.</p>

<p>Anyhow Uncle Wiggily hopped across the field to the edge of
the forest where Jackie and Peetie had said the big show was
going to be given that afternoon. Surely enough there was the
large white tent, much larger than the one the camping boys had
used the time Uncle Wiggily helped dig a rain-water canal for
the lads, so they would have dry beds to sleep in.</p>

<p>There was the circus tent!</p>

<p>And there were red, green, yellow, blue and purple posters
showing pictures of lions, tigers, camels, elephants and all such
wild animals.</p>

<p>"It's a regular circus surely enough," said Uncle Wiggily to
himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
"But how am I going to get in with the animal boys
and girls? I can't go up to the wagon and buy tickets, much as
I'd like to. I can't speak man-talk, though I can understand it.
How can I get in?"</p>

<p>Just then Uncle Wiggily saw two real boys slowly walking
around outside the big tent. They seemed to be looking for
something.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/p200_650.jpg" width="640" height="411" alt="It's a circus, surely enough, said Uncle Wiggily." />
</div>

<p>"I hope they haven't lost their ticket money," thought the
bunny. One boy said to the other:</p>

<p>"Here's a good place to get in!"</p>

<p>"All right! Crawl under!" exclaimed the other.</p>

<p>Then those two boys suddenly crawled under the circus tent,
because they had no money to buy tickets. Uncle Wiggily
watched them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
"Why! The idea!" exclaimed Mr. Longears. "What a way
to get in! Why&mdash;I have it! That's how I can get in with the
animal children! I can crawl under the tent! Of course I
wouldn't do it that way if I could buy them tickets, and get in
the regular way. But I can't&mdash;the ticket man wouldn't understand
if I hopped up with green or yellow leaf money. Crawling
under the tent is the only way."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily hopped back to the woods where he had built
his hollow stump bungalow. The animal children were gathered
about waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Come on. It's time to start!" said Susie Littletail, who had
on her best hat made of green ferns.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Wiggy?" asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, as she saw the bunny gentleman starting off at the head
of the procession of animal boys and girls.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm just going to take Baby Bunty to the circus," said
Mr. Longears, holding the littlest rabbit girl by her paw.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you aren't going for <i>yourself</i>?" asked Nurse
Jane with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" exclaimed the bunny. "The idea!"</p>

<p>On he hopped with the animal children, and when they came
near to the edge of the woods, where the circus tent gleamed
white amid the green trees, Uncle Wiggily said:</p>

<p>"Wait here, children, until I hop ahead and see if everything
is all right."</p>

<p>The bunny, hiding behind a bush, looked across a little field
at the tent. He saw two more boys walk softly up and try to
crawl under the white canvas, but all at once a man with a big
club rushed up, drove away the boys, and cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
"No, you don't! You can't get in this circus that way!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" thought Uncle Wiggily. "If men are on guard
to keep boys from crawling under the tent, they won't let me in
with the animal children! What can I do? Baby Bunty will be
so disappointed! Ha! I know! I'll start here in this field,
and dig a burrow, or tunnel under ground. I'll slant it down
until I'm beneath the tent, and then I'll slant it up, so when we
come out we'll be inside the tent. In that way the men with
clubs will not see us!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily hopped back to the waiting animal children.</p>

<p>"I'll have to dig a tunnel-burrow to get you into the circus,"
said the bunny. "Stay here and keep quiet!"</p>

<p>Starting in the field, behind the bushes and a little way from
the circus tent, Uncle Wiggily began to dig. He was a fast
worker, and soon he had dug the burrow all the way through.</p>

<p>He came out inside the circus tent, beneath the rows of seats
on which were perched many boys, girls and grown folk watching
the funny clowns, listening to the band, seeing the men on
the high trapeze bars and looking at the horses.</p>

<p>"Ha! The circus is just beginning!" said Uncle Wiggily to
himself, as the big bass drum boomed out: "Zoom! Zoom!"</p>

<p>He crawled back through the burrow and got the animal children
in line.</p>

<p>"Forward march!" cried Uncle Wiggily, and through the underground
burrow crawled the rabbits, squirrels, puppy dogs,
pussy cats, chickens, ducks, guinea pigs and all the smaller animal
friends of the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>They were not seen by the men with clubs, because they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
crawled beneath the tent far below the ground. Then they
came up inside the circus, under the high tier of seats.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it wonderful!" cried Baby Bunty, keeping hold of
Uncle Wiggily's paw.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered the rabbit gentleman. "Don't let the
people up above know we're down here or they might chase us
out!"</p>

<p>So there sat Mr. Longears and his little friends, having a fine
view of the circus almost from start to finish. And the people
sitting on the seats above dropped peanuts and kernels of popcorn
which the animal children picked up and ate. The only
thing they didn't have was pink lemonade, but perhaps that was
not good for them.</p>

<p>And at last, when the band began to play like anything, and
the horses and elephants raced around the big ring, Uncle Wiggily
said:</p>

<p>"Come, now. The circus is ended. We had better get out
before the crowd starts or we may be stepped on. Did you like
it, Baby Bunty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was the most wonderful thing I ever saw!" sighed the
little rabbit girl. "Thank you, ever so much!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and we thank you also, Uncle Wiggily," called the
other animal children.</p>

<p>Then they crawled down through the burrow again, outside
the tent and came into the woods, through which they scampered
to their different homes. But they had been to the circus!</p>

<p>And if the window curtain doesn't roll up so fast that it flies
to the top of the ceiling, taking the gold fish with it, you shall
next hear about Uncle Wiggily and the lion.</p>

<h2><a name="XXX" id="XXX">STORY XXX</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, as Uncle Wiggily was hopping through
the woods, he heard a roaring sound, coming, it seemed, from a
distant clump of trees.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" exclaimed the bunny rabbit gentleman. "That's
thunder! I suppose we are going to have a storm. I didn't
bring my umbrella, but I can find a large toadstool, or mushroom.
That will do as well."</p>

<p>The animal folk often use toadstools for umbrellas, you know,
and Uncle Wiggily had done this more than once. The bunny
hopped on a little farther, and the roaring, rumbling sound
boomed out again.</p>

<p>"The thunder is coming nearer," thought Mr. Longears. "I
had better hurry if I am going to pick a toadstool umbrella!"</p>

<p>He limped on his red, white and blue striped rheumatism
crutch over toward a large mushroom (which, of course, isn't
the same as a toadstool, though they look alike), and Uncle
Wiggily was just breaking off the stem, so he would not get wet
in the thunder shower, when, all of a sudden, a loud voice
asked:</p>

<p>"Can you please tell me where the circus went to?"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily turned so quickly that he nearly lost the
twinkle from the end of his pink nose. For the voice that spoke
was almost as loud as thunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
"Was that you making the noise like a storm?" asked the
bunny as he saw a large yellow creature, with a great head, surrounded
by a fluffy mane, and a tail on the end of which was a
bunch of hair.</p>

<p>"It was," answered the big animal. "I'll try to speak more
gently if it hurts your ears. But, naturally, I have a loud voice,
being a lion, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew you were a lion. I remember seeing you in the
circus," spoke the bunny gentleman, who was not at all afraid.
"But tell me, why aren't you with the show now?"</p>

<p>"Because I ran away," the lion answered. "I got tired of
being shut up in my cage all the while, and, when the man left
the iron door open I slipped out. I've been hiding in the woods
ever since; but it is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
Now I wish I could go back to the circus. Can you please tell
me where it is?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say I cannot," Uncle Wiggily answered. "But
if you will come with me to my hollow stump bungalow&mdash;not
that you can get inside, for you are too large&mdash;why, perhaps
Nurse Jane may know where your circus is. She knows nearly
everything."</p>

<p>"Who is Nurse Jane?" asked the lion.</p>

<p>"She is Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, my muskrat lady housekeeper,"
replied the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"A rat, is she?" went on the lion. "I don't know much about
rats, but once a mouse gnawed the ropes, when I was caught in
a net, and set me free&mdash;that was before I joined the circus."</p>

<p>"Well, a muskrat is something like a big mouse," said Uncle
Wiggily, "so I think you will like Nurse Jane."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
"I'm sure I shall," the lion rumbled, trying to make his voice
soft and gentle.</p>

<p>"Well, then," went on Uncle Wiggily, "please come along
with me, and I'll try to find the circus for you. Nurse Jane
may know where it moved to, or some of the animal boys and
girls may tell us."</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily hopped through the woods, the lion stalking
along beside him, and soon they reached the hollow stump
bungalow of the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"Nurse Jane! Nurse Jane!" called Mr. Longears. "I have
brought home a friend with me!"</p>

<p>"Not to dinner, I hope, Wiggy," remarked Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy, from inside the bungalow. "I have a dreadful headache!
I haven't been able to wash the breakfast dishes yet, and
as for making the beds, and dusting the furniture&mdash;it is out of
the question! So if you want dinner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please tell her not to bother," whispered the lion. "I am
not hungry and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that thunder?" asked the muskrat lady, thrusting her
head, tied up in a wet towel, from her bedroom window.</p>

<p>And when the muskrat lady saw the big lion she screamed.</p>

<p>"Pray do not be frightened, my dear Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy,"
the lion said. "I just came with Uncle Wiggily to inquire where
I might find the circus, from which I foolishly ran away. But
I'll toddle on, and not bother you, since you are ill."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't really any bother," spoke the muskrat lady. "I
could get you a cup of tea. It was only your loud voice that
startled me."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," rumbled the lion, as gently as he could. "I'm
afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
 my voice is rather louder than the purr of a pussy cat.
But I can't help it."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not!" agreed Nurse Jane. "I wish I could ask
you in, but our bungalow was not made for lions."</p>

<p>"I'll come in and get him something he can eat outside,"
offered Uncle Wiggily. "By that time some of the animal boys
or girls, who know where the circus went, may come along, since
you don't know, Nurse Jane."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 611px;">
<img src="images/p207_640.jpg" width="611" height="441" alt="He ate nearly all the bungalow" />
</div>

<p>"No, I am sorry to say I don't know," spoke the muskrat lady,
as she went back to bed with her headache.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily took some carrot soup and some lettuce tea
out to the lion, but though the tawny creature said he was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
hungry, he ate nearly all there was in the bungalow, for his
appetite was much larger than that of the muskrat lady or Mr.
Longears.</p>

<p>"And now I would like to do you and Nurse Jane a favor,"
went on the circus chap, licking the soup off his whiskers with
his red tongue. "Couldn't I help wash the dishes or make the
beds?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not!" laughed Uncle Wiggily, thinking how
funny it would look to see a lion making a rabbit's bed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I am too large to get in the bungalow," went
on the roaring chap, in as gentle a voice as he could make come
from his throat. "But I know one way in which I can help!"</p>

<p>"How?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"With my tail," said the lion. "That isn't too large to put
through one of your windows. And on the end of my tail is a
tuft of fluffy hair, just like a dusting brush. Please let me stick
my tail in through the different windows. Then I can switch it
around, and dust the furniture for Nurse Jane."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can?" asked the bunny, doubtful like.</p>

<p>"Of course!" said the lion. "True, I never before have dusted
furniture in a bunny's hollow stump bungalow, but that is no
reason for not trying. Please give me a chance!"</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily opened all the windows. The lion backed
up, and thrust his tail first in one and then in another. When
his tail was in the parlor he switched it around&mdash;I mean he
switched his tail around&mdash;and the fluffy tuft of hair on the end
knocked all the dust off the chairs, table and piano. Soon the
parlor was as nicely dusted as Nurse Jane could have done it
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
In this way, with his tail, the lion dusted all the rooms in the
bungalow, even the one where Nurse Jane was lying down with
a headache. And when the muskrat lady saw the lion's fluffy
tail switching around on her chairs in such a funny way, she
laughed, and then, in a little while, her headache was all better.</p>

<p>"You certainly are a good houseworker," said the muskrat
lady as she got up and drank a cup of tea. "And you have done
me a great favor."</p>

<p>"Pray do not mention it," spoke the lion politely as he flapped
his tail in the air to rid it of dust. "It was a pleasure!"</p>

<p>Then along came Jacko Kinkytail, the monkey boy, and he
said the circus had moved on to a town about ten miles away.</p>

<p>"Thank you! I'll travel there and get back in my cage,"
rumbled the lion. Then, with a polite bow to Nurse Jane and
Mr. Longears, the tawny, yellow chap with the big voice walked
away through the forest. And every time the muskrat lady
thought of the lion thrusting his tail in through the window to
dust the furniture she had to laugh.</p>

<p>Now would you like to hear a story about Uncle Wiggily and
the tiger? Well, you may if the scrubbing brush doesn't take
the cake of soap out to the washrag's party and forget to bring
it back for the bathtub to play ball with.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXI" id="XXXI">STORY XXXI</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE TIGER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Uncle Wiggily! Oh, Uncle Wiggily!" called a voice after
the rabbit gentleman, as he was hopping away from his hollow
stump bungalow one morning.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" inquired the bunny, turning
around so quickly that his tall silk hat nearly slipped down over
his pink, twinkling nose. "Does the Woozie Wolf or the Fuzzy
Fox wish to nibble my ears?"</p>

<p>"I hope not!" exclaimed Nurse Jane, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
for she it was who had called. "But will you please
take my scissors with you, Uncle Wiggily?"</p>

<p>"Take your scissors? What for?" asked Mr. Longears.</p>

<p>"To have them sharpened," answered Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.
"They are so dull I can hardly cut anything, and I want to cut
some linen up into new sheets and pillow cases. Take my scissors
along with you, Wiggy dear, and have them made good and
sharp."</p>

<p>"I will," promised the bunny rabbit gentleman. Then, wrapping
the dull scissors in a grape-vine leaf, Uncle Wiggily put
them in the top of his tall silk hat, and set the hat on his head.</p>

<p>"Why do you put them there?" asked Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"So I'll remember them," the rabbit gentleman answered.
"If I put them in my pocket I'd forget them. But now, if I
meet Mrs. Twistytail, the pig lady, or Mrs. Wibblewobble, the
duck lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and bow to them, I'll take off my hat. Out will slide
the scissors, and then I'll remember that I am to get them
sharpened."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," said Nurse Jane. "Now don't forget
to bring them back to me good and sharp. If you don't I can't
cut up into sheets and pillow cases the new linen I have bought."</p>

<p>"I'll not forget," promised the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>He hopped on and on through the woods, and he had not gone
very far before, all of a sudden, he heard a growling, rumbling-umbling
noise, a little like far-off thunder.</p>

<p>"I wonder if that can be the lion again?" thought Uncle Wiggily.
"Perhaps he couldn't find the circus and he has come back
to dust more furniture for Nurse Jane with the end of his tail
stuck through a window in the bungalow."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily looked through the forest, but he saw no
tawny lion. Instead he saw, limping toward him, a beast almost
as big as the lion, but with a beautiful black and yellow
striped coat.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! Mr. Tiger&mdash;the one I saw when I went to the circus
with Baby Bunty!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "This is a
tiger!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am the striped tiger," answered the other animal.
"And, oh, what trouble I am in!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" kindly asked the rabbit gentleman,
for he could see that the tiger was limping and in pain.</p>

<p>"I ran a thorn in my foot," went on the black and yellow fellow,
"and my eyes are so poor I can't see to pull it out."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can," Uncle Wiggily said. "I have strong
glasses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
So the bunny gentleman looked through his spectacles, and
soon saw the thorn that was in the tiger's foot. It did not take
Uncle Wiggily long to pull it out.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, so much!" growled the tiger, though not in a
cross voice. "It serves me right, I suppose, for having run away
from the circus."</p>

<p>"Did you run away, too, as the lion did?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the striped beast, "we ran away together&mdash;the
lion, some other animals and myself. But now I'd be glad
to run back again."</p>

<p>"The lion was," said Uncle Wiggily. "He was very glad to
go back."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you have met <i>him</i>!" exclaimed the tiger.
"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He started back yesterday, after stopping at my bungalow
and helping Nurse Jane dust the furniture with his tail through
the windows," the bunny answered.</p>

<p>"Then I'm going back, too!" declared the tiger. "It isn't as
much fun roaming by yourself through the woods as I thought
it would be. I'm going back!"</p>

<p>"Before you start," kindly suggested Uncle Wiggily, "please
come to my bungalow with me."</p>

<p>"Does more furniture need dusting?" asked the tiger, laughing.
"I have no fluffy tuft on the end of my tail, as has the
lion."</p>

<p>"It isn't that," the bunny answered. "But I would like to
have Nurse Jane put some salve on the place where the thorn
ran in your paw, and also wrap it up in a rag."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
"That would be very nice," spoke the tiger. "Right gladly
will I come with you."</p>

<p>So he limped through the forest with the bunny gentleman,
and soon they came to the hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>"More company for you, Nurse Jane!" called the jolly rabbit
uncle.</p>

<p>"That's nice," answered Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy. "Oh, you're a
tiger, aren't you?" she went on, as she saw the striped beast.</p>

<p>"And he has a sore paw," spoke Uncle Wiggily. "Will you
put salve on it for him, Nurse Jane?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered the muskrat lady. And when the
tiger's sore paw was nicely wrapped in a clean rag, he started off
through the woods to find the circus.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, and come again," invited Uncle Wiggily, making
a low and polite bow with his tall silk hat.</p>

<p>"I will," promised the tiger. And then the bunny suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, your scissors, Nurse Jane! I forgot all about getting
them sharpened," and he picked them up from where they had
fallen when he took off his hat.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! That's too bad!" said the muskrat lady. "And
I wanted to cut the linen in strips to make sheets and pillow
cases. Now it is so late I'm afraid the sharpening place will be
closed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help," said the tiger, turning back.</p>

<p>"Can you sharpen scissors?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"No," was the answer, "but my claws are sharper than any
scissors you ever saw. If you and Nurse Jane will hold the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
cloth, I will cut it into strips for you with my sharp claws. I
don't need to use my sore paw. I'll take my other one."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be very kind of you," said Nurse Jane. "I forgot
that tigers have sharp claws."</p>

<p>So the muskrat lady and the rabbit gentleman held the linen
cloth in front of the tiger, and with his claws he cut and slashed
it into just the shapes Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy needed for making
sheets and pillow cases.</p>

<p>"I am very glad I could do you this favor," the tiger said,
when all the linen was cut.</p>

<p>"So am I," spoke Uncle Wiggily, "for if you hadn't been
here to use your claws, Nurse Jane would not have forgiven me
for not remembering to get the scissors sharpened. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" echoed the tiger, as he walked on to find the
circus. And that night he slept in his cage again.</p>

<p>So if the doorknob doesn't try to crawl through the keyhole
to play bean bag with the rice pudding in the gas stove oven, I'll
tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the elephant.</p>

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE ELEPHANT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Matches, Uncle Wiggily! Matches!" cried Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy one morning, as the bunny rabbit gentleman was
hopping down the forest path, away from his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>"What's that? Patches?" exclaimed Mr. Longears. "Did I
put on my garden trousers that have patches?" and he tried to
twist his neck like a corkscrew, so he could look behind him.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't say '<i>patches</i>'!" laughed Nurse Jane. "I said
<i>matches</i>. Don't forget to bring me some matches to light the
fire, when you come back from looking for an adventure."</p>

<p>"Oh! Matches!" repeated the bunny. "I'll get some for
you, Nurse Jane."</p>

<p>Over the fields and through the woods hopped the bunny rabbit
gentleman. He looked here, there and everywhere for an
adventure, but could not seem to find one. The Woozie Wolf
nor the Fuzzy Fox did not chase him to nibble his ears. Not
that Uncle Wiggily wanted them to, but, if they had, that would
have been an adventure.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I shall find one when I come back," said the
bunny gentleman as he hopped along to the seven and eight
cent store, where he bought a box of matches.</p>

<p>Carrying these fire-sticks in his paw, Uncle Wiggily was hopping
through the forest, on his way back to the hollow stump
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
bungalow when, all at once, the bunny gentleman felt the
ground trembling, and he heard a sound like a big horn being
blown, and then a loud voice said:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I can't get it out!"</p>

<p>"Well, what can this be?" thought Uncle Wiggily. "That
horn sounds like the big brass one I heard in the circus. From
the way the earth shakes I'd say a big automobile truck was
coming along. And as for someone who can't get something
out&mdash;well, that sounds like trouble! I'd like to help, but first
I must see who it is."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily looked through the bushes, and at first he
thought he saw the side of some big house moving behind the
trees. Then he noticed something like a great leaf flapping in
the wind, and a moment later something long, like a fire hose,
was thrust forward.</p>

<p>"Why, it's an elephant!" exclaimed the bunny, as he caught
sight of the big chap.</p>

<p>"An elephant is just who I am," was the answer in a rumbling
voice, coming through the rubber hose of a trunk. "I'm from
the circus, and I wish I might be back there this minute, eating
my hay!"</p>

<p>"Oh, so you have run away from the circus also, like the lion
and tiger?" questioned the bunny.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the elephant, "I did. But what do you
know of my friends, the lion and tiger?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have met them," answered Mr. Longears. "But is
that your only sorrow&mdash;wishing you were back in the circus?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is not," the elephant answered. "I have stepped
on a loose stone, and it is fast between the toes of my left hind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
foot. I can't get it loose by stamping on the ground, and I can't
reach so far back with my trunk. I'm in great pain and
trouble!"</p>

<p>"That is too bad," spoke Uncle Wiggily. "I guess your
stamping on the ground is what I thought was an auto truck
coming along."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," admitted the big circus elephant. "I wish I could
get that stone out from between my toes," he went on, stamping
so hard that he shook the very trees, making them rustle as
though a wind had blown them.</p>

<p>"Maybe I can help you," said Uncle Wiggily most kindly. "I
have with me my red, white and blue striped rheumatism crutch.
With that I may be able to poke out the stone that hurts you."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd try," begged the elephant.</p>

<p>It did not take the bunny gentleman long to loosen the stone
from between the elephant's toes, for the foot of an elephant is
not like that of a horse or cow&mdash;he really has toes and toe-nails,
just as you have, only a little larger, of course. Well, I should
say so!</p>

<p>"Ah, I feel much better, Uncle Wiggily! Thank you!" spoke
the elephant through his hollow rubber hose-like trunk, and it
sounded like a trumpet or brass horn when he talked. "Now
that the stone is out of my foot I shall go back to the circus."</p>

<p>"The path to the place where the circus is now showing leads
past my bungalow," said the rabbit gentleman. "I'll hop along
and point out for you the way. I'd like you to meet Nurse
Jane."</p>

<p>"That will give me pleasure, also," remarked the elephant,
who was very polite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
So he and Uncle Wiggily went along together, but several
times the bunny had to say:</p>

<p>"Please don't go so fast, Mr. Elephant. I can't keep up with
you."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," spoke the immense chap. "Suppose I
lift you upon my back and carry you that way?"</p>

<p>"I should much like that," the rabbit uncle said. So in his
trunk the elephant gently lifted up Uncle Wiggily, and set him
down on the broad back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 608px;">
<img src="images/p218_640.jpg" width="608" height="447" alt="Ah, this is even better than my auto, said Uncle Wiggily" />
</div>

<p>"Ah, this is even better than my auto," laughed Uncle Wiggily,
as the elephant crashed his way through the forest. Soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
they came to the hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p>"More company for you, Nurse Jane!" called Uncle Wiggily,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Eh? What's that? Where are you? I don't see anybody
but a big elephant?" cried the muskrat lady, looking up.</p>

<p>"I'm on his back!" answered the bunny. And as the elephant
lifted Mr. Longears down in the trunk, Nurse Jane was so surprised
that she hardly knew what to say.</p>

<p>"Will you&mdash;er&mdash;have a cup&mdash;I mean a <i>washtub</i> of tea?" the
muskrat lady asked, well knowing that so big a creature must
drink a lot of everything.</p>

<p>"Some water is all I need, thank you," answered the elephant.
"I had something to eat in the forest before I met Uncle Wiggily."</p>

<p>Then the big chap put his trunk down in the brook and sucked
up a great quantity of water. Uncle Wiggily put the box of
matches down on the bench at the side of the bungalow, where
the sun shone bright and hot, and watched the elephant drink.</p>

<p>"Well, now I'll travel along and go back to the circus," said
the big chap with the large trunk and little tail. "I'll tell the
lion and tiger I met you."</p>

<p>"Please do." begged the bunny, and then, all of a sudden
Nurse Jane cried:</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire! Fire! Oh, the sun has set off the box of
matches, and the bungalow is burning! Fire! Fire! Fire!"</p>

<p>Surely enough, this had happened. The box of matches,
fizzing and spluttering, was burning Uncle Wiggily's bungalow.</p>

<p>"Turn in an alarm; Get the firemen! Call out the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
bugs!" cried the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"Just a moment! Don't get excited!" spoke the elephant
calmly. "I will put out that fire in a second!"</p>

<p>He sucked up more water from the brook in his trunk and
squirted it on the blaze. The fire hissed and spluttered and died
out in a puff of smoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have saved my bungalow!" cried Uncle Wiggily.
"Thank you ever so much! Only for you I'd be burned out of
house and home!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! That wasn't any more than you did for me&mdash;taking
the stone out of my foot," said the elephant. "With my rubber
hose-nose of a trunk, I very often put out little fires."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad Uncle Wiggily met you!" sighed Nurse
Jane. "If he hadn't, our bungalow would have burned down,
perhaps, Mr. Elephant!"</p>

<p>"Well, one good turn deserves another," laughed the elephant
as he tramped away through the forest to find the circus,
and the bunny gentleman and Nurse Jane waved "Good-bye"
to the big chap.</p>

<p>So if the wheelbarrow doesn't catch cold when it runs after
the train of cars to get a ride around the block, the next adventure
will be about Uncle Wiggily and the camel.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXIII" id="XXXIII">STORY XXXIII</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CAMEL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"What sort of an adventure do you think you will have to-day,
Uncle Wiggily?" asked the muskrat lady housekeeper of
the bunny rabbit as he hopped away from the hollow stump bungalow
one morning.</p>

<p>"Well, Nurse Jane, I hardly know," was the answer. "I may
meet with some of those queer circus animals again."</p>

<p>"I hope you do," Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy said, as she tied her
whiskers in a bow knot, for she was going to dust the furniture
that day. "The circus animals are very kind to you. And it is
strange, for some of them are such savage jungle beasts."</p>

<p>"Yes," spoke the bunny gentleman, "I am glad to say the
circus animals were kind and gentle. More so than the Pipsisewah
or Skeezicks. But then, you see, the circus animals
have been taught to be kind and good&mdash;that is, most of them."</p>

<p>"I hope you never meet the other sort&mdash;the kind that will
want to nibble your ears!" exclaimed Nurse Jane as Uncle Wiggily
put his tall silk hat on front-side before and started off
with his red, white and blue striped rheumatism crutch under
his paw.</p>

<p>"I hope nothing happens to him," sighed Nurse Jane as she
went in to put the dishes to bed in the china closet.</p>

<p>But something was going to happen to Uncle Wiggily. You
shall hear all about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
On and on through the woods hopped the bunny rabbit gentleman,
looking first on one side of the path and then on the
other for an adventure. He was beginning to think he would
never find one when, all of a sudden, he heard a rustling in the
bushes, and a voice said:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I can't go a hop farther! I'm so tired, and my
bundle is so heavy. I guess I'm getting old!"</p>

<p>"Ha! That sounds like trouble of the old-fashioned sort!"
murmured Uncle Wiggily to himself. "I may be able to give
some help, as long as it isn't the fox or wolf, and it doesn't
sound like them."</p>

<p>The bunny gentleman peered through the trees and, sitting
on a flat stump, he saw an old gentleman cat, looking quite sad
and forlorn.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Cat!" called Uncle Wiggily, cheerfully, as he
hopped over toward the stump. "What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of trouble!" mewed the cat. "You see I'm a peddler.
I go about from place to place selling pins and needles
and things the lady animals need when they sew. Here is my
pack," and he pointed to a large bundle on the ground near the
stump.</p>

<p>"But what is the matter?" asked the bunny gentleman.
"Don't the animal ladies buy your needles, pins and spools of
thread? Just step around and see Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
my muskrat lady housekeeper. She is always sewing and mending.
She'll buy things from your pack."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't <i>selling</i> them that's the trouble," said Mr. Cat.
"But I am getting so old and stiff that I can hardly carry the
pack on my back any longer. I have to sit down and rest because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
my back aches so much. Oh, how tired I am! What a weary world this is!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" laughed Uncle Wiggily, who felt quite
cheerful that morning. "See how the sun shines!"</p>

<p>"It only makes it so much hotter for me to carry the pack on
my back," sighed the cat.</p>

<p>"Ha! That is where I can help you!" exclaimed Mr. Longears.
"I am quite well and strong, except for a little rheumatism
now and then. That, however, doesn't bother me now, so
I'll carry your peddler's pack for you."</p>

<p>"Will you? That's very kind!" said the cat. "Perhaps I
may be able to do you a favor some day."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be all right!" laughed the bunny, as he
twinkled his pink nose. "Come along, we'll travel together and
perhaps find an adventure."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily slung the cat-peddler's pack up on his back,
the pussy carried the bunny's crutch, and so off they started together
through the woods. They had not gone very far, and
the bunny was wondering whether he could not sell Nurse Jane
a lot of pins to help the poor cat when, all of a sudden, a loud,
snarling sort of voice cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, where can I find some water? Oh, how much I need a
drink! I can go without one for seven days, but this is the
eighth and if I don't see some water soon I don't know what
will happen!"</p>

<p>"I wonder who that is?" asked the peddler cat.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but we'll soon find out," spoke Mr. Longears.</p>

<p>They looked through the bushes and there they saw a very
strange animal, and not what you would call pretty, either.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
This animal had a long neck, bent like the letter U, and his face
looked as though he had rolled over on it in his sleep. But the
queerest part of all was his back, on which were two humps,
like little mountains, running up to peaks.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a queer chap!" mewed the peddler cat.</p>

<p>"Hush, don't let him hear you!" whispered Uncle Wiggily.
"I think this is an animal from the circus."</p>

<p>"You are right&mdash;I am!" exclaimed the two-humped chap,
looking toward the bushes behind which Uncle Wiggily and the
cat were standing. "I heard what you said, too, Mr. Cat," the
odd chap went on. "But I don't mind. I'm a camel, and I'm
used to hearing folks say how queer I look. But I am in trouble
now. Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Uncle Wiggily, kindly.</p>

<p>"I'm so thirsty," the camel said. "You see, I took a long
drink before I ran away from the circus, which I did, very foolishly,
as I wanted some adventures. Well, I'm having them, all
right! I've been lost in the woods, and, though I had enough
to eat I couldn't find a thing to drink. On the desert, where I
came from, I could find water once in a while. But here I'm
lost."</p>

<p>"And, though I am a camel," went on the humped creature,
"and can hold enough water in my stomach to last for several
days, now my time is up. I haven't had a drink for over seven
days, and unless I get one soon I don't know what will happen."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can take you to the duck pond and you can get a drink
there, Mr. Camel," Uncle Wiggily said, as he hopped out from
behind the bush.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! What a funny chap you are!" snarled the camel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
not that he was cross, only a snarl was his regular way of speaking.
"Are you a little camel?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, I'm not a camel," answered the bunny. "What
made you think so?"</p>

<p>"Because of that hump on your back," said the camel. "Some
of us camels have two humps, and some only one. But surely
you cannot be a one-humped camel! I never saw one with ears
so long!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I'm not a camel!" laughed Uncle Wiggily. "I'm a
rabbit, and this pack that you see belongs to this poor peddler
cat, who is too tired to carry it. So I am carrying it for him."</p>

<p>"That is very kind of you," spoke the thirsty circus animal.
"In fact, it seems to me you are very fond of being kind, Mr.
Longears. You carry the cat's pack, and now you offer to
show me where to get a drink. And, if you can, I wish you would
soon lead me to water. I am very thirsty!"</p>

<p>"Follow me!" called Uncle Wiggily. Then he hopped off
through the woods, carrying the cat's peddler pack, and followed
by the two-humped camel, whose long neck swayed to
and fro like a clock pendulum, while his humps shook like two
bowls full of jelly.</p>

<p>Soon they came to the duck pond and there the camel put
his queer face down into the water and drank as much as he
pleased. He took a long time to drink, as camels always do,
for they must take enough into their stomachs to last for a week
in case they can not find more water before the end of seven
days.</p>

<p>The cat and Uncle Wiggily stood watching the camel, thinking
how queer and homely he was, but honest for all that, when,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
all of a sudden, out from behind a bush jumped the bad
old Pipsisewah!</p>

<p>"Wow! Wow! I've got you now!" howled the Pipsisewah.
"I'll nibble your ears now, Uncle Wiggily!"</p>

<p>The bunny rabbit gentleman started to run, but, because he
had strapped to his back the pack of the cat peddler, the bunny
could not hop fast at all.</p>

<p>"I'll get you! I'll get you!" cried the Pipsisewah.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! Oh dear!" sighed Uncle Wiggily, wondering
who was going to save him, for he knew the tired old cat
peddler couldn't.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, the circus camel finished his long
drink, and, with a jolly snarl, he cried:</p>

<p>"Here! You let Uncle Wiggily alone!" Then with his
broad foot, made big and wide so it would not sink into the
soft sand of the desert, the camel stepped on the tail of the
Pipsisewah, holding him back so he couldn't chase Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Wow! Wow!" howled the Pip.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed the peddler cat. "Oh, mew!"</p>

<p>"Just wait until I get loose, and I'll chase you, too!" cried
the Pipsisewah to the cat. "Just wait!"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid!" said the camel, with a smile which made
him look more homely than before, though this didn't matter.
"Here, Uncle Wiggily, hop up on my back, between my two
humps! You, too, Mr. Cat, jump up on my back. You and the
bunny gentleman can sit there as the people of the desert used
to ride me before I joined the circus. Hop up, my kind friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and I'll soon carry you safe out of these woods. I can go fast,
now that I have had a big drink of water. Hop up!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily, with the cat's pack, hopped up on the back
of the camel. The cat, too, sprang up. All the while the camel
kept his broad foot on the tail of the Pipsisewah, so the bad
animal couldn't get loose. And when the bunny and cat were
safe in place, snuggled down in between the camel's humps,
the queer creature started off, letting go the tail of the Pip.</p>

<p>"Ha! Now you can't get us!" mewed the cat, looking down
from the camel's back.</p>

<p>"Just you wait! I'll get Uncle Wiggily yet, and you too!"
the Pip howled. "And I'll fix you, Mr. Camel, for stepping
on my tail!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! Nonsense!" snarled the camel, "Uncle Wiggily
helped me by showing me where to find water, and now I am
helping him." And away he went, quite fast, indeed, for such
a queer chap.</p>

<p>And the old Pip skipped away to put some soft moss on his
sore tail.</p>

<p>"Isn't this jolly!" laughed Uncle Wiggily, twinkling his
pink nose. "I never expected to have a ride on the back of a
camel! It's just like a circus parade! I wish Nurse Jane
could see me!"</p>

<p>And the muskrat lady did, for the kind camel gave Uncle
Wiggily a ride all the way home to the bunny's hollow stump
bungalow, and when the muskrat lady housekeeper saw Mr.
Longears up between the two humps she cried:</p>

<p>"My land sakes flopsy dub and a basket of soap bubbles!
What will happen next?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
"I don't know," laughed Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"As for me, I am going back to the circus," the camel said.
And he did. The peddler cat, after selling Nurse Jane some
sewing silk, stayed for some time with Mr. Longears, getting
rested so he would be strong enough to carry his own pack of
needles, pins and thread. And as for the bunny&mdash;well, he
had more adventures, of course.</p>

<p>And the next one will be about Uncle Wiggily and the wild
rabbit&mdash;that is if the teaspoon doesn't take the cork out of
the bottle of bitter medicine and give it to the rag doll to make

<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WILD RABBIT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"There he is again!" cried Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, as
she ran to the window of the hollow stump bungalow and
looked out. "He's digging up all the nice carrots in your
garden, Uncle Wiggily!"</p>

<p>"Who is?" asked the bunny gentleman, laying aside the
cabbage-leaf newspaper he was reading, with his glasses perched
on his pink, twinkling nose. "Who is taking my carrots, Nurse
Jane?"</p>

<p>"That wild rabbit," answered the muskrat lady housekeeper.
"He lives in the thick bushes in the middle of the woods. I
think he hasn't been here very long, and he doesn't seem to
know any of your other animal friends. He's wild and runs
the minute I go out. But he has been spoiling your garden
lately."</p>

<p>"That isn't nice of him," said Uncle Wiggily. "I'll go out
myself and see what he has to say."</p>

<p>But as soon as Uncle Wiggily started down the steps of his
hollow stump bungalow, toward where the other bunny was
digging up the carrots, the wild rabbit hopped away.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" asked Uncle Wiggily,
twinkling his pink nose in a friendly way. "Why are you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>spoiling my garden?"</p>

<p>"Because I like to!" answered the wild rabbit. "You live in
a fine hollow stump bungalow, and all I have is a hole in the
ground, or burrow. You're rich and I'm poor, and I'm going
to spoil everything you have!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that isn't a good way to feel!" said Uncle Wiggily
kindly. "That's the way the Bolshevics talk! I used to be
poor, like you, but I went off to seek my fortune and I found it.
I built me this hollow stump bungalow, and, if you like, I'll
show you how to make one. Nurse Jane and I will help you!"</p>

<p>"Nope!" cried the wild rabbit. "I'd rather be bad! I'm
going to dig in your garden every chance I get, and you can't
catch me, either, so there!" And it sounded as if that wild
rabbit might be making a funny "face" at Uncle Wiggily.
Mind you, I'm not saying for sure, but maybe!</p>

<p>"Dear me!" thought Mr. Longears, as he went back in his
house. "That wild rabbit is certainly a queer chap. I don't
want to hurt him, but I wish he would get tame. I'll have to
speak to Policeman Dog Percival about him, and set Percival
on guard in my carrot patch."</p>

<p>"Did you make that wild rabbit stop his digging?" asked
Nurse Jane, as she met Uncle Wiggily coming in.</p>

<p>"No, he says he's going to be bad," sighed the bunny gentleman,
as he took his tall, silk hat down off the rubber plant.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"Out in the woods to look for an adventure," answered Uncle
Wiggily. "And perhaps I may find a way to make that wild
rabbit tame and good."</p>

<p>"I hope so," sighed Nurse Jane. "It isn't nice to have our
garden spoiled."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
As Uncle Wiggily was hopping through the woods, over on
that side of the forest nearest the village, where the real children
lived, the bunny gentleman, all of a sudden, heard the
voice of a little girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, Donald!" said the little girl, in sad tones. "You've
broken it. You've spoiled my nice little jumping bunny!"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't mean to," answered a boy's voice. "He
jumped all right a minute ago!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you went and squeezed the rubber ball too hard,
that's what you did!" sobbed the little girl. "And now my
nice Easter bunny won't hop any more! Boo hoo!"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily to himself. "This
is too bad! There's trouble here! I wonder if I can help?"</p>

<p>You see Uncle Wiggily knew what the boy and girl were
saying, though the bunny himself could not speak their talk.
Uncle Wiggily hopped softly nearer the children. He looked
through the bushes, and there he saw a little boy trying to mend
a toy bunny for the little girl.</p>

<p>The toy bunny was made to look like a real one, with ears
and fur and everything. Fastened to the toy was a little rubber
hose and a rubber ball was on the end of the hose.</p>

<p>When the toy rabbit was placed on the ground, and the rubber
ball was pressed, some air was squeezed inside the bunny's
legs, and he would hop across the floor; and his ears would flop
up, too, because he had springs and other things inside him.</p>

<p>"There's no use squeezing the ball," sadly said the little girl.
"My toy bunny is broken, and won't ever hop again! Oh,
dear! Boo hoo!"</p>

<p>"My! This is too bad!" said Uncle Wiggily. "I wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
what I can do to make that little girl feel happier? I might
get Sammie or Susie Littletail, the rabbit children, to come and
stay with the real children for a while. They seem to be kind&mdash;this
boy and girl. They wouldn't hurt Sammie or Susie.
That's what I'll do! I'll go get the Littletail brother and
sister, and have them hop over here so this boy and girl can
easily catch them and play with them a while."</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily started off through the woods. The boy
and girl sat in a moss-covered dingly dell, trying to mend the
broken toy. And Mr. Longears had not gone very far before,
all of a sudden, he came to a little hollow place, filled with
leaves. There he heard a voice saying:</p>

<p>"Oh dear! Oh what a pain! Oh what trouble I am in!"</p>

<p>"Ha! This seems to be my busy day for trouble!" exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily, as he looked at the leaf-filled hollow. "Who
are you, and what is the matter?" asked the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm the wild rabbit," was the answer. "The wild rabbit
who was eating the carrots in your garden. But alas! I
can eat no more!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Uncle Wiggily asked.</p>

<p>"Because I have fallen and broken my leg," was the answer.
"I can hop no more, and I suppose I shall have to stay here
and starve. I'm sorry I was bad, and tried to spoil your
garden, Uncle Wiggily."</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps you didn't really mean it," the bunny gentleman
said. "But wait here a minute. I think I can help you."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you only would!" sighed the wild rabbit with a
broken leg.</p>

<p>"I think I see a chance here," said Uncle Wiggily softly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
himself, "to help that boy and girl, and also the wild rabbit."</p>

<p>Off hopped Uncle Wiggily through the woods. It did not
take him long to reach the place where the boy and girl had
been playing with the hippity-hop rabbit toy that was now
broken. The children were still there. The little girl had sat
down on a log to cry, and the boy was trying to make her a
willow whistle so she wouldn't feel so unhappy. The broken
toy rabbit lay on a pile of leaves some distance away from the
boy and girl. I suppose they had tossed it there, thinking it was
of no more use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 605px;">
<img src="images/p233_640.jpg" width="605" height="422" alt="He's hopping off by himself!" />
</div>

<p>"This is just what I want," said Uncle Wiggily. He found
a long piece of wild grape vine, like a small rope, and, when
the boy and girl weren't looking, Uncle Wiggily slipped up
and fastened one end of the grape-vine cord to the broken toy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Then, hopping off behind the bushes, Uncle Wiggily began
pulling the piece of vine. Of course he also pulled the toy
rabbit along the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" suddenly cried the little girl. "Look, Donald!
My toy rabbit is all right again! He's hopping off by himself!"</p>

<p>And, surely enough, the toy did seem to be hopping away.
But this, as you know, was because Uncle Wiggily was pulling
it by the grape-vine string.</p>

<p>"Come on! Help me catch him!" begged the little girl.</p>

<p>"I will!" her brother said. Together they raced on after the
toy, which Uncle Wiggily jerked along the forest path. The
bunny gentleman kept out of sight behind the bushes, and as
the wild grape vine was just the color of the earth and leaves
the children did not see it. To them it looked as if the toy
was hopping away all by itself.</p>

<p>"I say, Mab!" called Donald. "He hops better than he ever
did before! I wonder who is squeezing the rubber ball? I
can't see anyone."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's fairies," suggested Mab, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Pooh! There aren't any fairies!" laughed Donald.</p>

<p>On and on ran the boy and girl after the skipping toy rabbit,
and Uncle Wiggily pulled it so fast as he hopped along, out
of sight, that Donald and Mab could not get their hands on
the toy. It kept ahead of them all the way.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily knew what he was doing and, in a little
while, he led the boy and girl up to the place where the wild
rabbit with a broken leg lay in the bed of leaves. Uncle Wiggily
jerked the toy rabbit close to the wild one, and then pulled
the toy out of sight behind a clump of ferns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
"Oh, Don! Look!" cried the girl. "Our toy rabbit has
changed into a real one!" And she pointed to the wild rabbit,
which could not move away, though he wanted to very much,
as his heart beat very fast.</p>

<p>"A toy rabbit couldn't change into a real one!" said the boy.</p>

<p>"Well, mine did; else how could this live rabbit be here,
and my toy one gone?" asked Mab. For that is what seemed
to have happened, all on account of Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"And see, Don," went on the little girl, as she knelt down
beside the poor, wild bunny. "His leg is broken, just as my
toy rabbit's leg was broken. Oh, it is the same one! My toy has
changed into a live rabbit! Oh, you poor, sweet, lovely
darling!" cried the little girl, as she cuddled the wild rabbit
up in her arms.</p>

<p>"Say! This sure is queer!" exclaimed the boy. "Very
queer!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily, peering through the bushes where he was
hiding with the broken toy rabbit, looked out and saw the little
girl holding the wild rabbit with its broken leg. The wild
rabbit would have hopped away if it could, but was not able.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Uncle Wiggily! Is this how you
help me?" sadly cried the wild rabbit. Of course, he spoke
in rabbit talk, which neither the boy nor girl understood. But
Uncle Wiggily, hiding in the bushes, heard and softly answered:</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, wild rabbit. These children will be kind
to you, I know. They will take you home, and mend your
broken leg and you will be as stylish as I am."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I'm going to be <i>stylish</i>, that's different!" said the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
wild rabbit. Then he nestled down in the girl's arms, and she
and the boy took the bunny home and their father mended the
broken leg with splints of wood and soft cloth bandages.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that wild rabbit won't spoil my carrots any
more," laughed Uncle Wiggily as he hopped along. "I'll take
this broken toy home to Sammie and Susie."</p>

<p>As for the wild rabbit, he was no longer frightened when he
heard Uncle Wiggily say that the children would be kind. And
no one could have been more kind than were Donald and Mab.
When the wild rabbit had to stay quiet until his leg healed,
they brought him, every day, fresh lettuce and carrots, with
cool water to drink. And when the leg was all well, the wild
rabbit was so tame that he never wanted to leave the boy and
girl, and go back to spoil Uncle Wiggily's garden. He lived
happily with Donald and Mab all the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Sammie and Susie had fun playing with the broken toy, and
they thought Mr. Longears was very clever to think of a way
to not only help the wild bunny and the boy and girl, but also
to save his carrots from being eaten.</p>

<p>So if the strawberry shortcake doesn't try to stretch itself up
tall and look like a big mince pie, I'll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the tame squirrel.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXV" id="XXXV">STORY XXXV</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE TAME SQUIRREL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, as Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny
rabbit gentleman, was hopping through the woods, he heard a
rustling in the bushes, and he crouched down to hide himself.</p>

<p>"For," thought the bunny, "this may be the Pipsisewah or
the Skeezicks, or even the Woozie Wolf or the Fuzzy Fox. I
had better be careful!"</p>

<p>But when Uncle Wiggily looked over the top of the bush,
whence the rustling sound had come, all he saw was the tame
rabbit, who once had a broken leg. The rabbit, who was now
tame, was hopping along the forest path.</p>

<p>"Hello!" called Uncle Wiggily in his most jolly voice, as
he twinkled his pink nose upside down, just for a change.
"Where are you going, Tame Rabbit? I shall call you that
as a new name. I hope you are not going to run away from
Donald and Mab, the boy and girl who were so kind to you."</p>

<p>"Indeed I am not running away," answered the Tame Rabbit.
"I am just going to the woods to look for some flowers.
Don and Mab are going to have a little woodland party this
afternoon, and I want to get them some flowers to put on the
flat stump which they will use for a table."</p>

<p>"That is very kind of you," Uncle Wiggily said. "I'll
help!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to come to the party?" asked the Tame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Rabbit, as he and the bunny gentleman hopped into the forest
together. "There will be lots of good things to eat&mdash;even ice
cream!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'd better not come, as some of the boys and
girls might not be as thoughtful as Mab and Don," spoke Uncle
Wiggily. "Some of them might throw peanut shells at my
tall, silk hat; just for fun, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps they might," admitted the Tame Rabbit.
"I don't wear anything but an old cap&mdash;nobody tries to knock
that off," he added with a laugh. "But can't you just look in
at the party, Uncle Wiggily? Just stop for a moment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll do that," promised Mr. Longears. And when he
had nibbled, with his teeth, some wild flowers for the Tame
Bunny, Uncle Wiggily hopped to his hollow stump bungalow,
promising to peek through the bushes at the children's party
later in the day.</p>

<p>That afternoon, as he was hopping through the woods, Uncle
Wiggily heard the sounds of shouting and laughter.</p>

<p>"That must be the party," thought the bunny gentleman.
"I'll skip over and take a look."</p>

<p>In a little moss-covered dingly dell among the trees, Uncle
Wiggily saw Don, Mab and many of their little boy and girl
friends dancing about a broad, flat stump, which was set like
a table. And in the middle was the bunch of flowers, some
of which Uncle Wiggily had helped gather.</p>

<p>"Those children are certainly having a good time!" thought
Uncle Wiggily, twinkling his pink nose so that it almost turned
a somersault. "And the Tame Rabbit, who used to be wild,
is enjoying himself, too." The other bunny surely was having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
fun, hopping here and there almost as if playing tag with the
children.</p>

<p>All at once Mab cried:</p>

<p>"Come on now! We'll eat!"</p>

<p>"Hurray!" cried all the boys.</p>

<p>The girls didn't get so excited about it, but I think they were
just as glad to eat as were the boys. The children gathered
around the stump table, and I wish I could tell you all the
good things they had for the woodland party. But I'm not
allowed to do this for fear it would make you too hungry.</p>

<p>All I can say is that there was just the most lovely party-things
you ever heard of! The Tame Rabbit sat near Don
and Mab, eating what they gave him.</p>

<p>"Now we'll crack the nuts and play more games!" called
Mab, after a while.</p>

<p>But when she went to pass the nuts she found that they
were not cracked, and some of them had very hard shells.</p>

<p>"Oh, Don! Didn't you bring the nut cracker?" asked Mab.</p>

<p>"No, I thought you did," answered her brother.</p>

<p>"And I thought you did!" exclaimed Mab. "Oh, what shall
we do?"</p>

<p>"We can crack the nuts with stones on top of the stump,"
said one boy.</p>

<p>But when they tried this, some of the nuts flew away over
in the bushes, without getting cracked at all. Others hit the
girls on the ends of their noses. And some of the children
pounded their fingers instead of cracking the nuts.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Mab, as she saw what was going on. "My
party will be spoiled, all because we haven't a nut cracker."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
The Tame Rabbit heard all this. So did Uncle Wiggily,
who was looking on, hidden in the bushes. Both bunnies knew
what was said though they couldn't speak boy and girl talk.</p>

<p>"Can't you help the children, Uncle Wiggily?" asked the
Tame Rabbit, as he hopped out to the bush where the bunny
gentleman was hidden. None of the children saw the two
animals talking together.</p>

<p>"How do you mean help them?" asked Mr. Longears.</p>

<p>"By getting them a nut cracker," went on the Tame Rabbit.</p>

<p>"A nut cracker?" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "A squirrel
is the best nut cracker I know of. Ha! I have it! I'll send one
of the Bushytail brothers over here to crack nuts for the children.
I think the boys and girls will be kind to him. I'll go
get Johnnie or Billie."</p>

<p>Away hopped Uncle Wiggily through the woods, and soon
he met Johnnie Bushytail.</p>

<p>"Johnnie, don't you want to come and be a nut cracker for
some children?" asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" chattered Johnnie, who was a very tame
squirrel. "I love children," he said. "And I suppose I may
eat a few of the nuts I crack."</p>

<p>"Oh, surely," answered Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>The bunny gentleman led Johnnie back through the woods
to the children's party. The boys and girls were still trying
to crack the hard nuts, but they could not do it well at all.
Johnnie suddenly scrambled out of the bushes and up on the
flat stump, and, taking a nut in his paws, he cracked it, by
gnawing through the hard shell with his sharp teeth. Then
he took out the meat and laid it on a birch-bark plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
"Oh, look!" exclaimed Don, pointing to the Bushytail chap.
"A tame squirrel is cracking the nuts for us! Look!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 615px;">
<img src="images/p241_615.jpg" width="615" height="434" alt="Maybe he's a fairy! she whispered." />
</div>

<p>"Oh, the dear little thing!" cried Mab. "And see, he's all
dressed up like a real boy. Maybe he's a fairy!" she whispered
as Johnnie cracked more nuts.</p>

<p>"Pooh! There aren't any fairies!" said Don. "But he sure
is helping us!"</p>

<p>Johnnie sat up on the stump, his tail held straight up behind
his back, and he cracked nut after nut.</p>

<p>"This is fine!" whispered the Tame Rabbit to Johnnie, the
tame squirrel, while Uncle Wiggily, hiding behind a bush,
saw and heard it all. "The children will love you for this."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," answered Johnnie, in animal talk, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
the boys and girls could not hear. Then the tame squirrel
cracked many more nuts, eating some himself, for there were
more than enough for all the children at the party.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wonder if we could take this squirrel home with us,
as we took the Wild Tame Rabbit?" said the boy, as Johnnie
cracked the last nut.</p>

<p>"Try it," suggested Mab to her brother.</p>

<p>But when Donald put out his hand, and tried to catch
Johnnie, the squirrel boy just flipped his tail and scampered
away.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'd rather not be caught," chattered Johnnie,
though of course Don and Mab did not know what he was saying.
Then, when the woodland party was over, the children
went home.</p>

<p>So that's how it all happened, as true as I'm telling you. And
if the Jumping Jack doesn't stick beans in the sugar cookies,
in place of the raisins he takes out to put in the molasses candy,

I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the wolf.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXVI" id="XXXVI">STORY XXXVI</a><br />
<span>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WOLF</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was hopping through the woods with Nurse
Jane one day, wondering what sort of an adventure he might
have, and he was helping the muskrat lady housekeeper carry
some clothes pins that she had bought at the three and four
cent store when, all of a sudden, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy called
loudly:</p>

<p>"Look out!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Uncle Wiggily. "Am I spilling
the clothes pins?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the muskrat housekeeper of the hollow
stump bungalow. "But, see that big wolf! Let's run!"</p>

<p>"Where's any wolf?" asked the bunny gentleman. "I don't
see any," and he began searching in his pockets for his
spectacles, which he had taken off, as they tickled his pink,
twinkling nose.</p>

<p>"There's a big, gold wolf, over behind that mulberry bush,"
whispered Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>"What's that? A <i>gold</i> wolf? I never heard of such a
thing!" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. "You must be mistaken,
Nurse Jane. I'll take a look!"</p>

<p>Then bravely singing the song&mdash;"Here we go 'round the
Mulberry Bush,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
 Uncle Wiggily hopped up to where Nurse
Jane pointed. Surely enough, something was gleaming gold-like
among the trees, and as soon as Uncle Wiggily had put
on his glasses, and had taken a good look, he cried:</p>

<p>"Well, well, Nurse Jane! This is a gold wolf, surely
enough! But it cannot hurt us!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the muskrat lady, who was getting ready
to run.</p>

<p>"Because it is only a wolf carved out of <i>wood</i>, and painted
like gold," answered the bunny gentleman. "I see what this
is&mdash;it is one of the gilded wolves that were on the Little Red
Riding Hood chariot from the circus. This golden, wooden
wolf fell off the wagon and the circus people did not stop to
pick it up."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad it's a wooden wolf," spoke the muskrat
lady. "Then it can't nibble your ears; can it?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," laughed Uncle Wiggily. "But if I had
a wheelbarrow, or something, I'd take this wolf home to my
bungalow."</p>

<p>"What for?" Nurse Jane wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd set it in the hall, near the umbrella rack," said
Uncle Wiggily. "Just think! A golden, wooden wolf would
be quite an ornament."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Nurse Jane, "it might look nice. But how
can you get it home? It is too heavy to drag, and it has no
wheels on as the animals have in the Noah's arks."</p>

<p>"Hum! Let me see, now," said Uncle Wiggily, walking
around the golden, wooden wolf. "If I only had some wheels!"</p>

<p>And just then, along through the woods came Billie and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Nannie Wagtail, the goat boy and girl, each with roller skates
dangling by a strap over their shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, Billie! The very chap I wanted!" laughed Uncle
Wiggily. "Let me take your roller skates for the golden wolf!
And you too, Nan!"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," bleated Billie, shaking his horns. "I'll
help you fasten them on."</p>

<p>"Will the wolf bite?" asked Nannie, a bit timidly.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" laughed Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>So the roller skates were fastened on the paws of the golden,
wooden wolf, and then, with a bit of wild grape vine for a rope,
the gilded animal from the Red Riding Hood circus wagon was
dragged through the woods to Uncle Wiggily's bungalow.</p>

<p>There the savage creature, who couldn't bite even a lollypop
stick, was placed in the hall near the front door.</p>

<p>"Our friends will think us quite stylish like and proper,"
said Uncle Wiggily, admiring the wolf ornament.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Nurse Jane. "As long as it doesn't scare any
of the animal children it will be all right."</p>

<p>But the animal children soon learned that the wolf was only
made of gilded wood, and though his mouth was widely open,
showing his sharp teeth, he could never, never bite them.</p>

<p>One day, about a week after he had brought the gilded wolf
to his bungalow, Uncle Wiggily was home all alone. Nurse
Jane had gone to the movies, with Mrs. Wibblewobble, the
duck lady, and the bunny gentleman was just thinking of going
to look for an adventure, or a piece of pie in the pantry, when,
all of a sudden, there came a knock at his door.</p>

<p>"That must be Nurse Jane," said Uncle Wiggily. "She is
back <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
 a bit early, and has, I suppose, forgotten her key. I'll let
her in."</p>

<p>The bunny gentleman opened his bungalow door, but, instead
of his muskrat lady housekeeper he saw the bad old
Skeezicks.</p>

<p>"Ah ha!" cried the Skeezicks. "I fooled you, didn't I? You
thought I was Nurse Jane and you came to let me in! Now I'm
going to nibble your ears! Ha! Ha!"</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily tried to shut the door, but the bad Skeezicks
pushed his way in, and was just going to nibble the bunny's
ears when, all of a sudden, the impolite Skee saw the golden
wolf.</p>

<p>Coming into the dark hall, as he did from the bright outdoors,
the Skeezicks could not see that the wolf was not real.
It looked so natural that the Skee stopped short and then he
cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me! Oh, I didn't know you were here, Mr. Wolf,
or I never would have come in. You are going to nibble Uncle
Wiggily's ears, I suppose. You have the first turn. Well, I'll
nibble them some other time, when you have finished. Please
excuse and don't bite me! I'll skip right long!"</p>

<p>And with that, out of the door the Skeezicks jumped, never
hurting the bunny gentleman at all.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed Uncle Wiggily, as he closed the door.
"The golden, wooden wolf did me a good turn after all! He
scared away the Skeezicks. I'm glad the circus wolf lives in my
bungalow!"</p>

<p>And Nurse Jane said the same thing when she came home
from the movies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
So this teaches us that it is a good thing to have something
of gold around the house, even if it is only a gold dollar.</p>

<p>But now we have come to the end of this book. Not that
Uncle Wiggily's adventures were over, for he had many more.
But these are all I have room for here. Enough to say that the
bunny rabbit lived happily for many, many years in his hollow
stump bungalow in the woods, with Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy.
And there you may, perhaps, see him some day.</p>

<p>Who knows?</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
